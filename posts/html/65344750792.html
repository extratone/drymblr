Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re so excited to announce the launch of our first-ever Feminist You Should Know campaign [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/fysk2013/">http://feministcampus.org/fysk2013/</a> ]. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re on the lookout for amazing college feminists across the country. People who are dedicated and passionate about social justice. People who wear the word &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; proudly on their sleeves. People who are creating real change on their campuses and in their communities. </p>

<p>Does this sound like a friend? Does this sound like you? If so, you just might be a contender for our contest and could win a fabulous feminist prize package. </p>

<p>Nominations open today [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/nominate/">http://feministcampus.org/nominate/</a> ]! Our National Campus Organizers will pick the finalists, and then our readers will pick the winners. </p>
