Dry, </p>

<p>Tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll be joined by hundreds of activists outside the Supreme Court to support the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s birth control benefit, which is being challenged by two for-profit companies trying to get out of providing contraception to their employees. We&rsquo;ll also be delivering thousands of petitions to the Court [ <a href="http://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/03/24/feminist-majority-foundation-to-deliver-thousands-of-petitions-to-the-supreme-court-tomorrow-in-support-of-the-aca-birth-control-benefit/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=10517&amp;preview_nonce=07fcc93803">http://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/03/24/feminist-majority-foundation-to-deliver-thousands-of-petitions-to-the-supreme-court-tomorrow-in-support-of-the-aca-birth-control-benefit/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=10517&amp;preview_nonce=07fcc93803</a> ] supporting birth control access for millions of women. </p>

<p><br/>
The ACA birth control benefit requires insurance companies to cover all FDA-approved contraceptives as part of preventive care, meaning millions of women can now access birth control without having to pay copays, coinsurance, or deductibles. But tomorrow, the Court will hear from two for-profit companies that claim they should not have to follow the law because they disagree with some forms of contraception. </p>

<p>*Women, not bosses, should make their own personal decisions about birth control. **RSVP today to join [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=81499">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=81499</a> ] us outside the Court tomorrow and stand up for contraceptive access [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=81499">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=81499</a> ].
