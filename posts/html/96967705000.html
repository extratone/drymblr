<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>The average woman uses 12 personal-care products a day filled with 168 ingredients, many of which contain toxic substances. Contrary to what you probably assume, the Food and Drug Administration is not legally required to test or regulate the products. </p>

<p>This means your lipstick, your lotion, your nail polish could contain carcinogens, mercury or hormone-disrupting chemicals. </p>

<p>*Our latest issue of *&ldquo;*Ms.*&rdquo; [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] examines the ugly side of beauty products in a hard-hitting expos√© by Heather White, director of the Environmental Working Group. </p>
