<p>wrote last night:</p>

<p>Dear Friends in V-Day,</p>

<p>Here in Iraq, we are shocked every other day with a new massacre.<br/>
After ISIS invaded the city of Mosul, one city fell after the other,<br/>
and the political and military establishment in Iraq turned out to be<br/>
a joke, but a bad one, for which millions of Iraqis had to pay the<br/>
price.</p>

<p>In the following weeks of June, &ldquo;Sunni&rdquo; ISIS attacked the Turkomen<br/>
Shia of the city of Telafar and caused the mass immigration of<br/>
hundreds of thousands. After killing hundreds of the men, and<br/>
kidnapping their wives and sisters and detaining them in what is<br/>
similar to concentration camps; in schools, a movie theater building<br/>
and in the airport. Hundreds of women were destined to becoming sexual<br/>
slaves and human shields in this city.</p>

<p>In July, many cities of Western Iraq were invaded also, Tikrit and<br/>
Baiji where the oil fields were taken, and tens of thousands of<br/>
residents turned into refugees.</p>

<p>Our OWFI branch in the city of Hawija was flooded by refugee women and<br/>
their children, who were sheltered in our offices, and then<br/>
distributed to the houses of our supporters. And Hawija also fell<br/>
under ISIS control, but with less atrocities, because many of the<br/>
locals joined ISIS ranks, due to the previous oppression of the Iraqi<br/>
government to them. Still, an ISIS leader came to our office and<br/>
questioned our representative ms. Khadija Husein angrily, asking where<br/>
her financing was from. The locals defended her, saying that her<br/>
services were very important and that they need it. Therefore, OWFI<br/>
has a branch which is open and functioning under the Islamic State<br/>
now.</p>
