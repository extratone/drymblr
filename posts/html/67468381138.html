<p>panel discussions in 2012 and 2013 as part of One Billion Rising.</p>

<p>Kimberlé is a leading authority in the area of Civil Rights,<br/>
Black feminist legal theory, and race, racism, and the law. Crenshaw<br/>
has worked extensively on a variety of issues pertaining to gender and<br/>
race in the domestic arena including violence against women,<br/>
structural racial inequality, and affirmative action. Crenshaw coined<br/>
two groundbreaking frames - Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality<br/>
- that have influenced scholarship and policy pertaining to<br/>
discrimination and the challenge of inclusion across multiple<br/>
disciplines and social contexts. A specialist on race and gender<br/>
equality, she has facilitated workshops for human rights activists in<br/>
Brazil and in India, and for constitutional court judges in South<br/>
Africa. Her groundbreaking work on Intersectionality has traveled<br/>
globally and was influential in the drafting of the equality clause in<br/>
the South African Constitution.</p>

<p>In 1996, Crenshaw co-founded the African American Policy Forum, a<br/>
gender and racial justice legal think tank, which houses a variety of<br/>
projects designed to deliver research-based strategies to better<br/>
advance social inclusion.  In 2011, Crenshaw founded the Center for<br/>
Intersectionality &amp; Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School,<br/>
which aims to foster critical examination of how social structures and<br/>
related identity categories such as gender, race, and class interact<br/>
on multiple levels, resulting in social inequality.</p>

<p>Wendy Schmidt is the President of The Schmidt Family Foundation, where<br/>
she works to advance the development of renewable energy and the wiser<br/>
use of natural resources.  The foundation houses its grant-making<br/>
operation in The 11th Hour Project<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=o23GtOZ9HIMGGVVtnnbNVQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=o23GtOZ9HIMGGVVtnnbNVQ</a></p>

<p>, which supports more than 150 nonprofit organizations in program<br/>
areas including climate and energy, ecological agriculture, human<br/>
rights, and our maritime connection.</p>

<p>The 11th Hour Project is currently partnering with V-Day to create the<br/>
V-World Farm<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=D4x2W4zo-CKzk4yDbUst4A">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=D4x2W4zo-CKzk4yDbUst4A</a></p>

<p>, a sustainable farm based on 338 hectares of arable land located near<br/>
the village of Nyanghezi, about 30 km South of Bukavu, approximately<br/>
20 km South of the City of Joy<br/>

<p>.</p>

<p>Wendy has been a supporter within the V-Day movement for many years<br/>
and has traveled to Bukavu, DRC to visit and support City of Joy and<br/>
the V-World Farm. In July 2013, Wendy was a featured speaker at &ldquo;CITY<br/>
OF JOY: The Story of Women Turning Pain to Power to Planting<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=yacKHKsaUEY5hVcNj12iJQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=yacKHKsaUEY5hVcNj12iJQ</a></p>

<p>,&rdquo; a panel discussion at The Paley Center for Media where she joined<br/>
V-Day Congo Director/Director of City of Joy Christine Schuler<br/>
Deschryver, Eve Ensler, and V-Board Members Pat Mitchell, Thandie<br/>
Newton, and Amy Rao.</p>

<p>In 2009, Wendy and her husband Eric Schmidt, created the Schmidt Ocean<br/>
Institute (SOI), and in 2012 launched the research vessel, Falkor, as<br/>
a mobile platform to advance ocean exploration, discovery, and<br/>
knowledge, and catalyze sharing of information about the oceans.<br/>
Furthering her commitment to ocean health issues, Wendy partnered with<br/>
XPRIZE to sponsor the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE, following<br/>
the Deep Horizon disaster, as well as the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health<br/>
XPRIZE, a prize that will respond to the global need for better<br/>
information about the process of ocean acidification, one of the<br/>
harbingers of climate change.</p>
