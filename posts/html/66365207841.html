                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Fast-food workers are fed up - and fighting back! </p>

<p>Our new edition of Ms. [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ], featuring a modern version of the classic Rosie the Riveter, brings you the story of fast-food workers across the country who are pouring into the streets and demanding a $15-an-hour wage. </p>

<p>Trust me: When you read the facts about an industry that primarily employs - and exploits - women, you&rsquo;ll never look at your hamburger the same way. </p>
