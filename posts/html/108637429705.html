                    <p>Dry, </p>

<p>We just came back from Louisiana. Believe us, *we must stand with Louisiana women* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16979">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16979</a> ] to stop the attack on abortion access. Clinics there are in peril. </p>

<p>The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals just issued new proposed restrictions on abortion providers. These restrictions, which are TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws, are aimed at making abortion care impossible, or nearly impossible, to access - and they would not improve the quality of care. </p>

<p>Abortion is extremely safe. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that abortion has over a 99 percent safety record, with a less than 1 percent complication rates following a procedure. In the extremely rare case of an emergency, providers have plans in place to protect patient safety. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) oppose medically unnecessary facility restrictions, just like those proposed in Louisiana now.</p>



<p><br/>
All these restrictions would do is impose rules that would cause safe and necessary clinics to close. *We can&rsquo;t let that happen.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16979">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16979</a> ] </p>

<p>*Sign the petition to stand with the New Orleans Abortion Fund - supported by the Feminist Majority Foundation - in demanding the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals rescind these dangerous TRAP regulations.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16979">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16979</a> ] </p>
