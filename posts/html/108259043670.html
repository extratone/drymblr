                    <p>VSL // A Mediterranean State Of Mind</p>

<p>* I brought back Ca'Vè Caffè beans from Cafe Venezia as last minute gifts three years ago. I didn’t know anything about it, other than that the café was cute and I wanted something that could only be found in Venice. To my surprise, it turned out to be the most delicious coffee, with an incredible story behind its beans <http:>. Upon request, they ship to the USA. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* All three times that I’ve lived in Florence I’ve found Via Porta Rossa to be the most enchanting. A stay at the ancient Hotel Porta Rossa <http:> puts you in the perfect location to just start strolling Firenze. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* I always search for the best Pilates studio in every city I travel to. Maiden Lane Studios <http:> in San Francisco has been my best discovery. I fell in love before I even walked through the door; it&rsquo;s on the most charming little street in Union Square. The beautiful boutique environment, challenging classes, and personal attention make Maiden Lane a must. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
