<p>We Rise With Yazidi Women! One Billion Rising &amp; Yazda Call on the<br/>
World for Global Solidarity With and For Yazidi Women on 3 August</p>

<p>This 3 August marks the two-year anniversary of the brutal attack of<br/>
the Yazidi people in Sinjar Province in the Northern region of Iraq,<br/>
Two years since IS or ISIL (also known as ISIS or Daesh) stormed<br/>
towns, villages, and historic homelands of the ethno-religious group,<br/>
killing over 5,000 men and elders, enslaving over 7,000 women and<br/>
children and displacing over 400,000 more. Two years since the<br/>
humanitarian crisis in which thousands of internally displaced Yazidis<br/>
were trapped on Sinjar Mountain, surrounded by Isis fighters<br/>
determined to exterminate the indigenous group, dying of exposure and<br/>
dehydration. Two years since the ongoing genocide of the Yazidi people<br/>
began, including the desecration of homes, holy sites and women&rsquo;s<br/>
bodies.<br/>

<p>The recently published Chilcot report in the UK, which revealed that<br/>
former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, and his major allies - including<br/>
former US President George Bush had illegally waged war in Iraq in<br/>
March 2003 and militarily occupied it - further reiterates the<br/>
connection that the Iraq War contributed to the rise of IS or ISIL in<br/>
the region.</p>

<p>Nadia Murad is a 23-year-old victim of Isil&rsquo;s crimes in Iraq and one<br/>
of the thousands of Yazidi women who were abducted and enslaved by IS<br/>
or ISIL. She was brutally raped by more than 12 members over a period<br/>
of three months and was among the more than 5,000 Yazidi women taken<br/>
captive when IS or ISIL swept through the group&rsquo;s communities in<br/>
Northern Iraq. After her escape, Nadia spoke out about her horrific<br/>
experiences at the hands of IS or ISIL fighters to draw attention to<br/>
the ongoing genocide. She has described how she and other young women<br/>
were forced to pray before they were raped, and how they were treated<br/>
as they were bought and sold like &ldquo;sabia&rdquo; - slaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were not worth the value of animals. They raped girls in groups,<br/>
They did what a mind could not imagine. They commit rape and genocide<br/>
crimes in the name of Islam. When they took me to Mosul to rape me, I<br/>
forgot about my mother and brothers. Because what they were doing to<br/>
the women was more difficult than death&rdquo; - Nadia Murad</p>

<p>YAZDA is a global Yazidi organization who provides support for the<br/>
victims of the genocide.</p>

<p>ON 3 AUGUST, WE CALL ON THE WORLD TO SHOW SOLIDARITY FOR NADIA MURAD<br/>
AND THE THOUSANDS OF YAZIDI WOMEN AND GIRLS SOLD AND CAPTURED AS SEX<br/>
SLAVES - AND CALL FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE CAPTURED 3,000<br/>
YAZIDI WOMEN.</p>

<p>WE CALL ON THE WORLD TO HONOR THE GENOCIDAL ATTACK ON SINJAR TWO YEARS<br/>
AGO. WE AS A GLOBAL COMMUNITY, MUST KEEP THEIR STORIES AND THEIR<br/>
SITUATION VISIBLE WITH THE STRENGTH OF OUR SOLIDARITY.</p>

<p>ORGANIZE SOLIDARITY EVENTS AND ACTION IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. Here are<br/>
some suggested actions:</p>

<p>MARCHES. VIGILS. WALKS. SOLIDARITY VIDEOS AND PHOTOS</p>

<p>SHOW YOUR SOLIDARITY ONLINE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  LETS FILL THE GLOBE<br/>
ONLINE WITH OUR SUPPORT FOR OUR YAZIDI SISTERS AND OUR DEMAND FOR<br/>
JUSTICE FOR THEM.</p>
