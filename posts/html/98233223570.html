<p>Stage an Event in 2015 - V-Registration Is Open!</p>

<p>Last year together we brought One Billion Rising for Justice to<br/>
communities and events worldwide! This year&rsquo;s theme, ONE BILLION<br/>
RISING REVOLUTION<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=siBDGEVLiQJPrGBBQQ6qkQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=siBDGEVLiQJPrGBBQQ6qkQ</a></p>

<p>, is a call to focus on revolution and change as an escalation of our<br/>
demand to end violence against women and girls once and for all.</p>

<p>ONE BILLION RISING REVOLUTION is an energy, a platform, a global<br/>
movement, a catalyst, a worldwide decision to end violence against<br/>
women, a demand for justice, a paradigm shift, an invitation, a<br/>
gathering of the ready, housed everywhere, housed in our hearts, you,<br/>
us, REVOLUTION.</p>

<p>With the tagline &ldquo;Drum, Dance &amp; Rise,&rdquo; Risings will focus on<br/>
highlighting, creating and envisioning new, brave and radical artistic<br/>
initiatives to bring in the new revolutionary world of equality,<br/>
dignity and freedom for all women and girls.</p>

<p>V-season is now open for registration!</p>

<p>The 2015 V-Season will be a transitional year, during which the<br/>
structure of the V-Day campaigns will begin to shift to an even more<br/>
autonomous, activist based model.</p>

<p>2015 productions of &ldquo;The Vagina Monologues&rdquo; will be held during the<br/>
month of February, and if you wish to perform the play in other<br/>
months, you may purchase the rights from Dramatists Play Service.<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=hhfiVTDyP2x-Z9JNd9rrvQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=hhfiVTDyP2x-Z9JNd9rrvQ</a></p>

<p>By focusing the benefit performances during one month - February - we<br/>
maximize the impact. Beginning in 2016, &ldquo;The Vagina Monologues&rdquo; will<br/>
be available free of charge to registered activists, every year solely<br/>
in the month of February. These productions will continue to raise<br/>
money for anti-violence work, and support and guidance will come from<br/>
a strong network of fellow activists. In 2016 and beyond, those<br/>
wishing to present &ldquo;The Vagina Monologues&rdquo; outside of February will<br/>
purchase the rights through DPS.<br/>

<p>V-Day&rsquo;s energy will channel into One Billion Rising. Revolutionize<br/>
your art and activism by creating your own OBR events, which can take<br/>
place any time during the year.</p>

<p>Please head to the V-Spot to get registered for your February event.<br/>
We understand that many of you may have already secured venues for<br/>
events in March or April of 2015. If this is the case, we are happy to<br/>
make an exception for you for the 2015 V-Season. As always, please let<br/>
us know at<br/>
