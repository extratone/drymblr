<p>V-Day Statement on the Passing of Sister Mary Nerney</p>

<p>All of us at V-Day were heartbroken to learn of the passing of Sister<br/>
Mary Nerney, a lifelong advocate for incarcerated women and survivors<br/>
of domestic violence.</p>

<p>We are blessed to have had the opportunity to work with Sr. Mary over<br/>
the years. As the Founder of STEPS To End Family Violence<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=H-nXkZ0VwCk4hY47b1ji8g">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=H-nXkZ0VwCk4hY47b1ji8g</a></p>

<p>, her dedication to ending violence against women and girls was<br/>
constant. The way she worked - with love, selflessness, and generosity<br/>
- will continue to inspire and fuel us.</p>

<p>Sr. Mary was a pillar in her East Harlem community and a leader in the<br/>
Catholic social justice movement. In addition to STEPS, she founded<br/>
Greenhope Services for Women, the Incarcerated Mothers Program, and<br/>
was a founding member of the Coalition for Women Prisoners at the<br/>
Correctional Association of NY and co-chair of the Coalition&rsquo;s<br/>
Violence Against Women Committee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I had given up on myself and lost all hope of ever being<br/>
released from prison&hellip;Sr. Mary was advocating for me. Telling people<br/>
they should not forget&hellip;they must not forget. I will forever be<br/>
thankful to her and for her&hellip;she became my mother.&rdquo; -Donna<br/>
Hylton, Community Health Advocate for the Coming Home Program and<br/>
longtime V-Day activist.</p>

<p>We send our deepest love to the STEPS family, and everyone who had the<br/>
pleasure of knowing and working with Sr. Mary.</p>

<p>In solidarity,<br/>
V-Day</p>
