<p>You won&rsquo;t want to miss this upcoming issue of Ms. – packed with critical analysis every feminist should know about for the new year. First we look at how the feminist factor – not just the gender gap – gave President Obama the extra push he needed to get reelected. Read how we can turn feminist-fueled election triumphs into gains for women and girls in Obama&rsquo;s second term. </p>

<p>Even as we celebrate our victories, we are bracing for the next round of attacks in the War on Women. What are the risks for women in the upcoming federal budget negotiations? Which states are trying to close off access to abortion and birth control? Find out in Ms. </p>

<p>An exclusive report looks at whether right-wing political pressure shoved the investigation of anti-abortion extremism under the rug – just as a new clinic is opening in Wichita. </p>

<p>The Winter issue also features: <br/>
  * A new short story by Marge Piercy <br/>
  * A Ms. conversation with Sarah Weddington, the attorney who argued – and won – the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case 40 years ago <br/>
  * And find out why &ldquo;Women are Back in the Kitchen&rdquo; </p>
