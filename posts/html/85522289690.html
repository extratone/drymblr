                    <p>VSL // Video Remix</p>

<p>* This is the first example of musical video <http:> I had ever seen. It made such a lasting impression on me, especially the chainsaw&rsquo;s rhythms&hellip; it changed the way I looked at music and video forever. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>today’s Very Short List:<br/>
tech 12 May 2014</p>

<p>Eclectic Method <http:> (aka Jonny Wilson), constantly pushes the technology of music, TV, and film to improve video remixing and create compositions that perk ears, move feet, and capture moments in time.</http:></p>

<p>* Whenever my head is getting big, I watch this video <http:> to remind myself how little I&rsquo;ve achieved. Cyriak is the M.C. Escher of musical video. His craftiness in splicing images together is next level. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* I became totally obsessed with video remixers Coldcut, so I hunted them down and they recommended I check out EBN, the New York AV remixers <http:> who had inspired them. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
