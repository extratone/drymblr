<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Operation Rescue/Operation Save America has just announced plans for yet another siege – this time in mid-October – of Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization (JWHO), the last remaining clinic in all of Mississippi. The clinic is so far winning in the court to stay open, but we must make sure the clinic&rsquo;s doctors and staff are safe as they work. </p>



<p></p>

<p>We need your help to pay for critically important new structural security measures and video surveillance systems for JWHO right now. Half of your tax-deductible gift will go directly to JWHO for improving security measures, and half will support our National Clinic Access Project that works to keep JWHO and other clinics targeted by anti-abortion threats and violence open and safe. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] </p>

<p>If the JWHO clinic closes, Mississippi women seeking safe legal abortions will have no choice but to travel hundreds of miles out of state to find a clinic. </p>

<p>Our Clinic Access Project assists clinics all across the country that are the targets of extremists&rsquo; severe harassment, violence and threats of violence. Our 2014 national survey of clinics shows that our work has helped to significantly decrease anti-abortion terrorism from a high of 54% of all clinics nationwide experiencing severe violence in the early 1990s, to 19.7% today. </p>

<p>But 1 in every 5 clinics still targeted by severe anti-abortion violence is unacceptable! And even more alarming, the survey found that more than half of clinics report their doctors and staff are targets of extreme harassment and intimidation – like the use of WANTED-style posters and KILLERS AMONG US leaflets. </p>

<p>There must be zero tolerance of violence and harassment aimed at vilifying doctors and health care workers. We are determined to stop anti-abortion violence – but to do that, we need your help. </p>

<p>*Please help us keep the courageous doctors, staff and volunteers at JWHO in Mississippi and at other targeted clinics across the country safe?* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] </p>

P.S. Without doctors and clinics to provide safe, legal abortions, there can be no choice for women. *Please make a tax-deductible gift to support our National Clinic Access Project today.
