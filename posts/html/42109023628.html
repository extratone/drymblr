<p>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S DISCOVERY:<br/>
The Rash Guard</p>

<p>Maybe it was last summer&rsquo;s Ditch Plains day trips or the recent rewatching of Blue Crush, but we&rsquo;re becoming kind of obsessed with all things surfing (disclaimer: whether or not we can actually stand up on a board), which is why we&rsquo;re so stoked about our new collection of rash guards that were designed with both the avid surfer and the total beach bum in mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more of a hang-out-on-my-towel kind of girl, but my siblings all surf and paddleboard up in New Hampshire and Maine, where it&rsquo;s freezing even in summer, so I created something we could all wear,&rdquo; says our swim designer, Amy. Our lineup features classic-cool stripes, punchy solids and fun florals with perfect-fit details like a slim silhouette, a longer hem that won&rsquo;t hike up and a back zipper for easy on and off. Plus, our rash guards all have UPF 50 sun protection, earning them a recommendation from the Skin Cancer Foundation. Pretty tubular, no?</p>
