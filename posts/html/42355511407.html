                    <p>Feminist Majority Foundation - Equality around the world </p>

<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>A petition for Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratification is currently collecting signatures through the We the People [ <a href="http://wh.gov/P6gP">http://wh.gov/P6gP</a> ] petition process on the White House website [ <a href="http://wh.gov/P6gP">http://wh.gov/P6gP</a> ]. </p>

<p>The ERA petition has over 18,000 signatures. If the petition has 25,000 signatures by 11:59pm on February 9, the White House staff will review it, send it to the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response. (Currently, the We the People process requires over 100,000 signatures, but the ERA petition was filed before the increased requirement.) </p>

<p>ERA march [ <a href="http://wh.gov/P6gP">http://wh.gov/P6gP</a> ] button [ <a href="http://wh.gov/P6gP">http://wh.gov/P6gP</a> ] </p>

<p>It is time to get the ERA back high on the national agenda. This petition asks the White House to support lifting the deadline on the original 1972 ERA. Women would only need three more states to get full rights if the deadline was lifted. Thirty-five states have already ratified the ERA. We need you to go to the White House website and sign the petition [ <a href="http://wh.gov/P6gP">http://wh.gov/P6gP</a> ]. </p>

<p>Sign it today [ <a href="http://wh.gov/P6gP">http://wh.gov/P6gP</a> ]. Women have waited long enough for equality. </p>

<p>For equality, </p>
