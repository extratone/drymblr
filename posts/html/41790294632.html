<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We have exciting news – *Ms* [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ]*. is now on your iPhone and iPad* [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ]! Beginning with the upcoming Winter 2013 issue you can read Ms. digitally – and of course, you can still get the print edition you know and love! (We will be releasing an Android version of Ms. very soon.) </p>

<p>Subscribe to Ms. today and you&rsquo;ll be one of the first to receive our fearless, feminist reporting on your iPad or iPhone.

[ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] </p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t want to miss this upcoming issue of Ms. – packed with critical information you need to know for the new year. We start by looking at how the feminist factor – not just the gender gap – made a critical difference in reelecting President Obama. Read how we can leverage feminist election victories into gains for women and girls in Obama&rsquo;s second term. </p>

<p>Even as we celebrate our victories, we are bracing for the next round of attacks in the War on Women. What are the risks for women in the upcoming federal budget negotiations? Which states are trying to close off access to abortion and birth control? Find out in Ms. </p>

<p>An exclusive report looks at whether right-wing political pressure shoved the investigation of anti-abortion extremism under the rug – just as a new clinic is opening in Wichita. </p>

<p>The Winter issue also features: <br/>
  * New short story by Marge Piercy <br/>
  * A Ms. conversation with Sarah Weddington, the attorney who argued – and won – the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case 40 years ago <br/>
  * And find out why &ldquo;Women are Back in the Kitchen&rdquo; </p>
