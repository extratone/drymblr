Hi y'all, </p>

<p>I can barely believe it - *us.org/conferences/2016-nyflc/ ] is less than two weeks away!! </p>

<p>For me, this conference has been a part of my life - and my feminism - for the past three years. And I have to tell you, I&rsquo;m excited for this one more than ever before. Because this year, we&rsquo;re pulling out all the stops. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re going to love this conference more than Leslie Knope loves waffles. More than Beyonc√© loves hot sauce. More than Kanye loves Kanye! We&rsquo;re talking about the issues you want covered with the activists you want to hear from (and already follow on Twitter). *Basically, this conference is all about you, so should why shouldn&rsquo;t you be here? [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2016-nyflc/">http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2016-nyflc/</a> ] *(You just have to register by *Monday March 7*!)</p>

<p><br/>
Student leaders just like you are flying in from across the country to share how you can tackle the critical issues on your campuses. And in case some of y'all have been living under a rock - there&rsquo;s a ton of super important elections happening this year. There&rsquo;s never been a more important time to learn about the issues and *Vote Feminist*! So if you&rsquo;re like me, and you want to make the world a more feminist place, then grab your bags and head to *s.org/conferences/2016-nyflc/ ]*! </p>

<p>For equality, </p>

Mid-Atlantic &amp; Northeast Organizer </p>
