<p>* Bitters are to cocktail creation as salt is to cooking! It’s an essential element that brings complexity and depth to a drink. Check out The Meadows <http:> for a stunning array of bitter choices – it’s where many New York bartenders go for ingredients. While you’re at it, drop a few gourmet chocolates into your cart. Whiskey and chocolate together taste heavenly. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Fresh fruits are essential for a cocktail whose aromas literally pop out of a glass. Check out organic fruit-of-the-month clubs like FruitShare <http:>, where fresh citrus are delivered right to your door, and try your hand at exotic fruit purees once you get going. There’s a whiskey cocktail recipe in my book that calls for a simple mango-puree, and the lush drink is lovely served on a hot summer evening with Indian Food. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Order a couple of essential bar tools from the Cocktail Kingdom <http:> for a chic and sexy home bar. They stock top-of-the-line and elegant pieces that professional bartenders from all over the country seek out. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
