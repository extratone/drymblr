                    <p>VSL // Stew Leonard&rsquo;s For The Holidays</p>

<p>* Each year, the number of Christmas trees that we sell at our Stew Leonard’s stores could be lined up to extend over 66 miles! If you haven’t picked your tree out yet, here are a few of my best tips <http:>. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>today’s Very Short List:<br/>
food 17 Dec 2014</p>

<p>Stew Leonard Jr. is the CEO and President of Stew Leonard’s <http:> grocery and wine stores, located in the NY tri-state area. We believe our stores, once dubbed the Disneyland of grocery stores, are a favorite among shoppers because of their friendly and fun atmospheres and our knowledgeable staff.

<p>* During the week leading up to Christmas, we&rsquo;ll sell enough ham and filets combined to give every person in the Giants&rsquo; stadium more than a half-pound of each! And no dinner table would be complete without a great, local wine <http:> pairing. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* &hellip;we&rsquo;ll also sell 10,000 gallons of eggnog that same week, which is enough to fill more than 135 bathtubs. But instead of fact-checking us on that one, we recommend you enjoy your eggnog, either in the traditional way as a tasty drink or in one of these many creative ways <http:>. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
