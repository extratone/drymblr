                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We have less than one week before the residents of Albuquerque vote on a dangerous 20-week abortion ban. We need your help to secure this crucial victory. </p>

<p>Please donate an emergency contribution today to stop this reckless legislation in its tracks. [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ] </p>

<p>The ballot measure, if approved, would allow the city government to interfere with a private decision between a woman, her family and her doctor. The measure contains no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the woman. </p>

<p>We cannot allow this city-level legislation to become precedent. If it passes, it could have far-reaching and alarming impact. Similar legislation is being introduced in Congress and other states.That&rsquo;s why we need your help today. </p>

<p>100% of your contribution will go to the Respect ABQ Women, [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ] a group of Albuquerque women, families, and allied organizations building a grassroots campaign to defeat this City of Albuquerque ballot measure that would mandate government interference in a woman&rsquo;s decision about abortion. </p>

<p>Feminist Majority Foundation has sent three National Campus Organizers to work on the ground in Albuquerque with our student groups. FMF is also phone banking city residents for support. We know we can win this fight. </p>

<p>Dry, we&rsquo;re doing all we can to stop this ballot measure. Will you help us in the final stretch? The local pro-choice coalition needs funding for media ads.  [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ] </p>

<p>In just the past two years, you have helped us defeat anti-abortion ballot measures in Mississippi, North Dakota, and Florida. And now with your help, we can also defeat this dangerous Albuquerque ballot measure and stop this city ordinance strategy in its tracks. </p>

<p>For Women&rsquo;s Lives, <br/>
