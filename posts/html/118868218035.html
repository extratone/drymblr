                                    <h1>PETITION: Stop the Inhumane 20-Week Abortion Ban!</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>House Republicans are at it again! *We need you to contact your Representatives &ldquo;now&rdquo; and tell them that you support access to safe, legal abortion. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11279">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11279</a> ]* </p>

<p>The House will vote *&ldquo;today&rdquo; *on an extreme, unconstitutional, 20-week abortion ban that would, once again, puts politics above women&rsquo;s health and rights. * [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17835">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17835</a> ]* </p>



<p></p>



<p>*We can&rsquo;t let that happen! [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11279">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11279</a> ]* </p>



<p></p>



<p>Not only is this ban an attack on &ldquo;Roe&rdquo;, its exceptions for rape and incest are inhumane and put undue burdens on victims under 18 to report to authorities and could re-traumatize and damage the victim. And victims over 18 must seek counseling or medical attention at least 48 hours before the procedure, causing multiple unnecessary trips to clinics. </p>

<p>House Republicans had previously attempted to pass this extreme bill on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, but were forced to pull the bill from the floor because they could not get adequate support. Anti-choice politicians are now saying that the ban is different, but make no mistake, this bill is a direct attack on women and Roe v. Wade and would ban even some pre-viability abortions. </p>

<p>Congress must stop wasting time and money on unconstitutional measures that attack women&rsquo;s health and rights.* **Tell Congress that enough is enough.

<p>We won&rsquo;t go back! </p>

<p>For Women&rsquo;s Lives, </p>
