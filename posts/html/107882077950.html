                    <p>Hey Dry! </p>



<p>*Time&rsquo;s running out to sign our petition and stand in solidarity with Tennessee women, [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] who are fighting multiple anti-abortion measures in the Tennessee legislature TOMORROW. *Take action now to show lawmakers in Tennessee and every state that we will not stand idly by as they attack reproductive rights.</p>



<p> [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ]</p>



<p>With new power to regulate abortion as a result of the narrow passage of Amendment 1 - a dangerous amendment in the state that strips privacy protections from the state constitution that prevented extreme abortion restrictions - Republicans plan to take up multiple anti-abortion measures tomorrow when the Tennessee legislature has its first day in session. These measure include unnecessary changes to clinic inspections, mandatory counseling, waiting periods, and ultrasounds before an abortion, and forcing doctors to deliver manipulative and deceiving information to their patients. </p>



<p></p>

<p>*That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re petitioning Governor Bill Haslam, Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey, and House Speaker Beth Harwell to implore them and the entire Tennessee General Assembly to respect women&rsquo;s rights and maintain the comprehensive access to modern health care Tennessee women have now without harassment and undue burden.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] When the legislature opens for session tomorrow, women&rsquo;s rights activists will be protesting outside to push back on these restrictions â€“ and we&rsquo;re sending in our signatures to stand with them.</p>



<p></p>

<p>*Sign the petition now and stop the state attacks on abortion rights. This fight is far from over.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] </p>
