<p>RISE w/ Eve &amp; OBR at The People&rsquo;s Climate March on Sunday, 21<br/>
September, in NYC!</p>

<p>Dear Risers,</p>

<p>We are in the midst of an environmental crisis and the time has come<br/>
to unite with our sisters and brothers across all sectors to demand a<br/>
new model of sustainable development, a model that includes safe,<br/>
people-centered renewable energy systems and reverses our current path<br/>
of environmental destruction.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 21 September, I am RISING at the People&rsquo;s Climate March in<br/>
NYC and I hope you&rsquo;ll join me!</p>

<p>The March will take place two days before the United Nations Climate<br/>
Summit, and we need to show the world leaders that we will not stand<br/>
by while they continue to ignore this crisis.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s help create the Largest Climate March in History!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the power of One Billion Rising to create a global shift in<br/>
consciousness around violence against women and girls. Let&rsquo;s use this<br/>
power to do the same with violence against our mother Earth.</p>

<p>We cannot ignore the historical and interrelated destructive treatment<br/>
of both women and nature in our current dominator model of societies.<br/>
The longstanding history of violating the Earth and violating women is<br/>
deeply rooted in the same problem and societal imbalances. To achieve<br/>
long term solutions, we will need to deal with root causes and<br/>
systemic change and this will mean liberating the silenced and<br/>
oppressed voices of women and nature.</p>

<p>Together we stand for the Earth and future generations. Together we<br/>
can make our voices heard. Together we can create a revolution.</p>

<p>Details for the meeting point and route below.</p>

<p>With gratitude and love,</p>

<p>Eve</p>
