<p>In Solidarity with Ferguson</p>

<p>One Billion Rising Revolution stands in solidarity with the people of<br/>
Ferguson and their demands for justice.  We stand in solidarity with<br/>
the African American Policy Forum and share their statement below.<br/>

<p>The stunning announcement that Darren Wilson will not face any charges<br/>
in the shooting death of Michael Brown is a bitter disappointment not<br/>
only to the immediate family of Michael Brown, but to all of those who<br/>
value justice, police accountability and human rights. We are<br/>
particularly disturbed by the actions of Robert McCulloch whose<br/>
prosecutorial performance failed to instill confidence that the grand<br/>
jury decision was fair. Indeed, the tenor and substance of the<br/>
announcement revealed a process that functioned more as an indictment<br/>
of Michael Brown than a determination of whether there was probable<br/>
cause to try Darren Wilson for any crime. This defendant-friendly<br/>
grand jury process underscores concerns that the criminal justice<br/>
system poses insurmountable obstacles to real police accountability,<br/>
while setting very low entry points that funnel so many people of<br/>
color into prison.</p>

<p>We have been reminded that we are governed by the rule of law, yet the<br/>
painful reality of Ferguson, and the longer history of white supremacy<br/>
that proceeded it, is that legality does not necessarily guarantee<br/>
justice. As Martin Luther King, Jr. observed, &ldquo;law and order exist for<br/>
the purpose of establishing justice [but] when they fail in this<br/>
purpose they [can] become the dangerously structured dams that block<br/>
the flow of social progress.&rdquo; In the pursuit of a just order, we must<br/>
be frank in addressing how racism has shaped the law and the<br/>
day-to-day lives of those who must live in fear under its shadow. If<br/>
the national conversation that many are calling for is to move us<br/>
toward justice, then the widespread tolerance and support for policies<br/>
and practices that endanger the lives of Black people must be<br/>
unequivocally condemned.</p>

<p>, we know that justice requires more than an indictment in this case<br/>
and in all the other tragedies that are unfolding. Our fight must be<br/>
for a comprehensive racial justice agenda that ensures full systems<br/>
reform. In addition to supporting actions in multiple arenas to ensure<br/>
that this critical moment will not pass, please join the coalition of<br/>
national civil rights organizations and individuals in demanding</p>
