<p>Update from Eve in Bukavu</p>

<p>March 9, 2014</p>

<p>Dear V-Day Supporters,</p>

<p>I am writing to you today from Bukavu, a delicious morning - a sweater<br/>
of heat, soft wind, and a sweeping melody of feisty birds. The smell<br/>
of jasmine drifts and palms sway, all infused with the holy sound of<br/>
church drums and singers in the distance.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you for your glorious support and for being part of<br/>
this community that is creating and spreading an oasis of<br/>
transformation, healing, and love.</p>

<p>Both City of Joy and V-World Farm are thriving in ways we never could<br/>
have imagined. Not only have we recently harvested seven tons of rice,<br/>
but by the end of May we will have graduated more than 400 young women<br/>
who have changed their own lives and are now impacting the lives of<br/>
those in their communities. City of Joy has become a full fledged<br/>
garden in all respects, the thick purple bougainvillea, the six foot<br/>
roses, the compost pile host to a stunning garden of cabbage and<br/>
carrots, 300 new chickens.</p>

<p>The women attending City of Joy are beautiful in their hearts, bodies,<br/>
and spirits. Their energy is nothing short of radiant and electric.<br/>
Their dance is the dance of those who returned from the edge, who have<br/>
stepped into their bodies and vitality, released their shame and rage<br/>
and hurt, and are now ready to seize the world.</p>

<p>The young women at City of Joy are hungry to learn and hungry to share<br/>
what they have learned. You can see this in all their programs  from<br/>
literacy, English, and computers, to human rights, self-defense, and<br/>
sex education. The women have also made a most wonderful CD of<br/>
original songs and a stunning music video. There is much creativity<br/>
and art emerging from City of Joy.</p>

<p>We also see the political impact of the program in the way girls are<br/>
asking questions of the government, demanding their rights, rising for<br/>
justice in the streets of Bukavu.</p>

<p>V-World Farm</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new: an incredible road that facilitates better access<br/>
to both sides of the land. We just harvested seven tons of rice. We<br/>
had 10 pigs a years ago, now we have 168 pigs. There are eight ponds<br/>
full of leaping Tilapia. There are ten young women from City Of Joy<br/>
who work the lands and all of the City of Joy residents learn<br/>
agriculture at the farm. There are avocados, Macademia nuts, pumpkins,<br/>
sweet potatoes, and orange trees.</p>

<p>The farm is now growing much of the food for City of Joy, reducing our<br/>
budget. We are mid-construction on the administrative building and<br/>
warehouse. Everything at V-World is recycled, all trees are turned<br/>
into wood for building. We even make our own cement. We are incredibly<br/>
grateful to the 11th Hour Project for making it all possible!<br/>

<p>V-Men</p>

<p>For years now the V-Men movement has been evolving both in Congo and<br/>
around the world. Dr. Mukwege, the Godfather of this movement, was<br/>
awarded the inaugural V-Men award (established in his name) in 2008 at<br/>
the Superdome in New Orleans. For months a core group of 20 men have<br/>
been meeting in Bukavu, designing a vision of what this movement looks<br/>
like and what it means to be a VMan. The selection of the 20 men was<br/>
based on commitment and background. They were chosen by other local<br/>
men who love and respect women. The group has advocates from a<br/>
multitude of sectors including lawyers, teachers, doctors, a<br/>
basketball referee, a psychologist, activists, military men and<br/>
policeman.</p>

<p>At the first meeting the group discussed the origin of V-Men. They<br/>
acknowledged the glaring gap in the feminist movement, which fights<br/>
against violence against women. In order to bridge this gap, they<br/>
decided they needed men to work in solidarity with women and share the<br/>
same vision.  It is clear that men have largely ignored their<br/>
responsibility in the community, namely to help protect women, speak<br/>
out against the atrocities, actively be equal partners, and support<br/>
women to go further and become leaders. Being a V-Man means breaking<br/>
out of what Tony Porter calls the &ldquo;Man Box.&rdquo; The V-Men group decided<br/>
to create a declaration</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=AuLdKlC4MvTffxVtAd6Diw">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=AuLdKlC4MvTffxVtAd6Diw</a></p>

<p>that calls forth other men to join. The statement aims to announce<br/>
that there are Congolese men who are committed and open and ready to<br/>
fight with women to end this violence.</p>

<p>We were all in awe to witness this historic launching in South Kivu of<br/>
the V-Men&rsquo;s movement and public reading of the proclamation, done in<br/>
chorus by the 20 men, including Marcellin Cishambo Ruhoya, Governor of<br/>
South Kivu, who has committed to sponsor a national gathering of men<br/>
from all over the country to escalate the movement.</p>

<p>One of the founders, Patrick Lwaboshi said, &ldquo;The idea is to spread the<br/>
seeds of the movement all over the Congo and the world. I joined the<br/>
movement after working by the side of women for 5 years and after<br/>
discovering men can easily convince other men to end violence against<br/>
women. Many of us men are tired and heart broken to keep hearing the<br/>
stories of rape and violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The launch on March 7, the eve of International Women&rsquo;s Day, was<br/>
wildly successful and many men joined the movement. It was picked up<br/>
by press all over the world, motivating other men to do the same.</p>

<p>Mayo Doctors</p>

<p>I would like to take this moment to honor some amazing doctors, three<br/>
of whom actually saved my own life when I was diagnosed with uterine<br/>
cancer. Deborah Rhodes, Sean Dowdy, Eric Dozois, Emanuel Trabuco and<br/>
nurse practitioner, Lois McGuire all traveled from the Mayo Clinic in<br/>
the U.S. to Panzi Hospital and spent days performing operations and<br/>
lectures with Dr. Mukwege. All of us at V-Day and City of Joy thank<br/>
them for their amazing generosity and all the medical supplies they<br/>
brought with them thanks to the Americares organization. We are<br/>
overjoyed they came to dance with us at City of Joy on the last day of<br/>
their visit.</p>

<p>A World of Thanks</p>

<p>And I want to thank every person who has done an event, organized a<br/>
run, raised money at their high school, college, office, or church, by<br/>
climbing mountains, throwing parties, or simply sending a check and<br/>
telling their friends about our work. Your support and connection is<br/>
crucial to our efforts. We cannot do this without you and we are<br/>
forever grateful for your being with us and staying with us.</p>

<p>Thanks also to our incredible donors who are joined in community in<br/>
the Circle of Joy (If you would like to join this circle, please let<br/>
us know, contact development@vday.org). Their very generous donations<br/>
and vision have allowed so much to happen.<br/>
