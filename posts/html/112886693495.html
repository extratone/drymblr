<p>* Maine: I no longer live in my home state of Maine <http:>, but I reminisced about it (and the concept of home) on my new album, AFTER. The final song on the album, ‘Atlas,’ showcases my love for Maine with lines like &ldquo;funny how a good thing opens your eyes, makes you feel the branches, leads you to the pines.” [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Incorruptibility: There has been a story on my dad&rsquo;s Italian side of the family of a great-great aunt whose body was exhumed years after burial and found intact. After a second exhumation, her body was deemed to be incorruptible <http:> and she was canonized and reburied in The Vatican. I felt compelled to sing about it on &lsquo;Billions of Eyes!&rsquo; [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* The Great Pyramids: Both 'Heretic&rsquo; and 'Spat Out Spit&rsquo; have moments inspired by reading a theory that the great pyramids were not burial tombs, and that they are aligned with the stars of Orion&rsquo;s belt <http:>. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
