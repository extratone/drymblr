Dear Dry, <br/>
South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9939">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9939</a> ] </p>

The South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center - a comprehensive reproductive health clinic in Wichita, Kansas, just opened last month. The new clinic is in the former clinic of Dr. Tiller, who was assassinated in his church by an anti-abortion extremist four years ago. </p>

<p>This new clinic is being threatened and needs our help! [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9939">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9939</a> ] </p>

<p>The clinic provides not only abortion services, but also birth control, well women exams, prenatal care, cancer screenings, STI testing and much more. </p>

<p>Even before it opened, the staff was being harassed and threatened. Executive Director Julie Burkhart, who previously worked for Dr. Tiller, is being stalked and her home is being picketed. </p>

<p>A recent audio recording was posted on YouTube that is purported to be Scott Roeder, the man who murdered Dr. Tiller. In the recording, the man identified as Roeder said of Burkhart: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like putting a target on your back, saying, &lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see if you can shoot ME!&rsquo;&hellip; I think eight have been shot, so we&rsquo;ve got 92 to go. Maybe she&rsquo;ll be number nine. I don&rsquo;t know, but she&rsquo;s kind of painting a target on her.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Enough is Enough! The South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center and its brave staff need more security support. Please donate today to provide critical protection for the clinic and its brave doctors and staff.

<p>Additionally, a courageous clinic doctor who flies in from out of state has been exposed by Operation Rescue and harassed with protests at her family practice in Illinois. </p>

<p>The Feminist Majority Foundation clinic defense team has been helping the new clinic in many different ways. Our team has traveled to Wichita several times and spent weeks on the ground helping to obtain security and to build community support. We will continue to help and we wanted to give you and all of our supporters an opportunity to help. We cannot let the terrorists win! </p>

<p>Will you give $5 or $500, $25 or $100, or even $5,000 today to help provide desperately needed security measures for the South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center and staff?  [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9939">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9939</a> ] </p>

<p>Your contribution will go directly to the clinic and personnel security measures. Let the staff know they are not alone and that people all over this nation won&rsquo;t let the terrorists win. </p>
