Stage a Benefit Event in 2016 - V-Season is Now Open for Registration!</p>

<p>Stage a Benefit Event in 2015</p>

<p>Let V-Season begin -</p>

<p>Beginning today, activists can register to produce a 2016 V-Day<br/>
benefit production of<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=rdhNFScE-JEL1RuPA5Esug">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=rdhNFScE-JEL1RuPA5Esug</a></p>

<p>The Vagina Monologues and/or A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant and A<br/>
Prayer.  The two artistic works will be available free of charge to<br/>
registered activists producing benefit performances during the month<br/>
of February.  By focusing the benefit performances during one month -<br/>
February - we maximize the impact. Already<br/>
returning organizers in over 130 locations have signed up for the 2016<br/>
season.*</p>

<p>Each year, thousands of V-Day benefit events take place produced by<br/>
volunteer activists in the U.S. and around the world. These efforts<br/>
have raised consciousness, changed laws to protect women and girls,<br/>
funded rape crisis centers and domestic violence shelters (in many<br/>
cases these much needed funds kept them from closing), educated their<br/>
communities, and raised over $100 million in urgently needed funds for<br/>
groups doing the essential work of ending violence and serving<br/>
survivors and their families.</p>

<p>V-Day 2016 Launch<br/>
Since V-Day launched in 1998, activists have also staged their own<br/>
works, reflecting the voices in their communities. If you would like<br/>
to foreground new voices in the conversation around ending violence<br/>
against women, we encourage you to do so by curating stories from your<br/>
community and creating a new artistic evening that you present<br/>
separately. Many organizers have done this, both instead of The Vagina<br/>
Monologues and in addition to The Vagina Monologues. Consider<br/>
revolutionizing your art and activism by creating new artistic events<br/>
local writers, activists and artists. READ about some examples from<br/>
past years &gt;<br/>

<p>The Revolution continuesÂ - One Billion Rising: Rise for<br/>
Revolution 2016 is an escalation of the first three stages of our<br/>
campaign. We&rsquo;ve danced, demanded justice, and demanded changes. This<br/>
year we are radicalizing our actions- enlarging, deepening and<br/>
expanding the revolution. Radically shifting consciousness with<br/>
braver, bolder, more creative and determined actions that focus on the<br/>
most marginalized women and girls to bring about true, long lasting<br/>
change.</p>
