                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>For far too long, anti-abortion politicians have interfered in reproductive health decisions by banning Medicaid and insurance coverage for abortion care. </p>



<p></p>

<p>*Urge President Obama to eliminate abortion funding restrictions from his Fiscal Year 2017 budget. [ <a href="http://signforgood.com/allaboveall/?code=feminist">http://signforgood.com/allaboveall/?code=feminist</a> ]* </p>



<p>These bans push safe and affordable abortion care out of reach for those struggling to make ends meet. When people can plan if and when to have children, it&rsquo;s good for them and for society as a whole. </p>

<p>By removing abortion funding restrictions from his FY 2017 budget, President Obama would help ensure that every woman would be able to get safe and affordable abortion care if and when she needs it. </p>

<p>*Tell President Obama that every woman-no matter her income-should have equal access to abortion. [ <a href="http://signforgood.com/allaboveall/?code=feminist">http://signforgood.com/allaboveall/?code=feminist</a> ]* </p>
