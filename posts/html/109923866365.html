                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

We&rsquo;ve extended * [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ]*Early Bird Registration for the 11th Annual National Young Feminist Leadership Conference [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ]! That means you&rsquo;ve got until Friday at 6PM EST to register and save on three days of feminist activism, conversation, and networking in the nation&rsquo;s capital!* </p>



<p>This year&rsquo;s NYFLC will be hosted at the DoubleTree Crystal City - just minutes from downtown Washington, DC - and cover topics like women&rsquo;s rights, LGBT rights, civil rights, attacks on contraceptive and abortion access, global reproductive rights, and more. On March 23, we&rsquo;ll close the conference with a trip to Capital Hill and tell legislators what matters to us. The NYFLC is your chance to meet campus activists, feminist and political leaders, and other public figures. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to take action, get inspired, network with other activists, and even grab some feminist gear or explore the nation&rsquo;s capital! </p>



<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna wanna miss out on this. **Register today. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ]*** (*We&rsquo;re also offering spectacular rates on lodging in the conference hotel for attendees - but space is limited, so the first folks to RSVP will save even more!) </p>



<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing a diverse array of feminists at the conference this year, and we hope you&rsquo;ll join us in celebrating more than a decade of young feminist action and leadership across the nation. </p>
