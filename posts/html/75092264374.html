<p>Dear Risers&hellip;A Letter From Eve</p>

<p>Dear Risers,</p>

<p>We are two weeks away. Many of us have worked for months to prepare<br/>
for our risings for justice. Some have just found out and signed up<br/>
and some have created a rising in their school, center, place of<br/>
worship, their block, in their office, factory, home or bedroom. Some<br/>
are planning with coalitions, others with local groups, some with<br/>
their best friends. Some are organizing to rise in squares,<br/>
courthouses, mines, military bases, college campuses, fields. Some in<br/>
their bodies, hearts and minds. Some are dancing on stages, others in<br/>
parks, in squares, in prisons, in auditoriums. Some are working to<br/>
bring out thousands, others just their close circle. Some are engaging<br/>
men and new activists. Some are gathering the courage to join any<br/>
group at all, or release their story, or dance in public or in the<br/>
streets which would, could mean risking their lives. Some are rising<br/>
to release their wounds, others are rising to articulate them.</p>

<p>Every rising is part of a collective energetic decision to end the<br/>
violence on this planet that has traumatized women and girls&rsquo; bodies<br/>
and robbed us of the full capacity of our life force and value. Every<br/>
rising is a dance of connection to end racial, environmental,<br/>
economic, and gender injustice.</p>

<p>There is no way to fail.</p>

<p>What matters is that we rise, that we name the injustice, that we<br/>
commit with our bodies and our communities that this rising on the<br/>
14th, like all the days that lead up to it and all the days that<br/>
follow it, is our life.</p>

<p>Each rising for justice is part of the river of justice, the current<br/>
of a new paradigm, an unstoppable wave, joining us through the<br/>
strength and encouragement of our global solidarity.</p>

<p>May this wave lift us and unite us. May it take us and surprise<br/>
us. </p>

<p>May it move us into love.</p>

<p>Eve</p>
