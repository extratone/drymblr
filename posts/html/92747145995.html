<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p><br/>
Support Clinics! [ org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227 ] *Become a &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; <br/>
Partner today! [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]* *<br/>

When Ms. magazine launched, the pundits were predicting the magazine would run out of things to say in 6 issues. Well, 42 years later, our reporting and truth-telling still fills the pages of what&rsquo;s been called one of the most influential magazines in U.S. history. </p>

<p>*To help make sure &ldquo;Ms. &quot;stays strong and independent, I&rsquo;m inviting you to join a very dedicated group of members, our &quot;Ms.&rdquo; Partners, and inviting you to join our &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; lifetime community member circle [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]*. </p>

<p>There are two ways to become a &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; Partner – you can make a one-time tax-deductible gift of $42 or more (a dollar for every year of &ldquo;Ms. &quot;and its truth-telling and trailblazing), or join our monthly sustainer program – at $10, $15 or $25 or more a month. With a donation of $1000 or more, you will become a lifetime member of the &quot;Ms. &quot;community. </p>

<p>*As a special thanks, we will list both &quot;Ms. &quot;partners and lifetime members in our fall &quot;Ms.&rdquo; Anniversary issue.* </p>

<p>*Dry [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]** [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]*, we hope you&rsquo;ll become a &ldquo;Ms. &quot;Partner or a lifetime community member* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ] [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]. As an incentive, a long-time &quot;Ms. &quot;reader has pledged a $25,000 challenge grant if we get 342 *new *&quot;Ms.&rdquo; Partners before the end of our drive. </p>

<p>Never has &ldquo;Ms. &quot;been more needed. From shocking Supreme Court decisions allowing bosses to decide their women employees&rsquo; birth control … to campus sexual assault … to the War on Women, &quot;Ms.&rdquo; is the leader in reporting on our lives. </p>

<p>Over the years, our covers have featured Wonder Woman – walking tall – just like &ldquo;Ms. &quot;But for &quot;Ms. &quot;to stay strong we need to know we can count on the support of a dedicated group of members – literally our Partners. </p>

<p>*Become a &quot;Ms. &quot;Partner and/or lifetime community member today, and see your name in &quot;Ms.&rdquo;!* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ] </p>
