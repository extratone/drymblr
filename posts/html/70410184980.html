Hey Dry! </p>

<p>When we launched the Feminist You Should Know contest [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/feminist-you-should-know-nominate-your-favorite-activist-today/">http://feministcampus.org/feminist-you-should-know-nominate-your-favorite-activist-today/</a> ], we didn&rsquo;t realize just how awed, inspired, and deeply moved we would be. </p>

<p>But we were. </p>

<p>And after much hard work sifting through over 200 nomination forms, the Campus Team was able to choose ten finalists [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/drumroll-please-announcing-the-feminist-you-should-know-finalists/">http://feministcampus.org/drumroll-please-announcing-the-feminist-you-should-know-finalists/</a> ]. We announced them last week, and afterward they spent the next five days sharing their stories about their journeys to feminism, the inspirational people in their lives, and their work. </p>

<p>This is where you come in: *we can&rsquo;t possibly choose a winner alone, so we need you to vote within the next week for one finalist and help us decide [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/vote-for-your-fave-fysk-2013-finalist-today/">http://feministcampus.org/vote-for-your-fave-fysk-2013-finalist-today/</a> ].* vote for an fysk finalist! [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/vote-for-your-fave-fysk-2013-finalist-today/">http://feministcampus.org/vote-for-your-fave-fysk-2013-finalist-today/</a> ] </p>

<p>We encourage you to read all ten essays by our finalists [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/tag/feminist-you-should-know/">http://feministcampus.org/tag/feminist-you-should-know/</a> ] before choosing someone to vote for, and we also encourage you to share their post or the call for votes on Twitter, Facebook, or other social media using the tag. Feel free to campaign, leave encouraging comments, or just vote quietly in peace! </p>

<p>Each finalist and every nominee will receive a prize package to honor their amazing contributions to this movement, so don&rsquo;t feel too guilty that you can&rsquo;t vote for them all! Just follow your heart, cast a vote, and leave the rest up to us. *Voting takes all of ten seconds thanks to our handy-dandy online form, so don&rsquo;t wait! [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/vote-for-your-fave-fysk-2013-finalist-today/">http://feministcampus.org/vote-for-your-fave-fysk-2013-finalist-today/</a> ]* </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be announcing a winner on the blog [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/blog">http://feministcampus.org/blog</a> ] next week once we&rsquo;ve tallied the votes. Good luck deciding! And once again, we&rsquo;d like to reiterate how floored we were by the nominations and essays we&rsquo;ve had the honor to read in these past weeks. </p>

<p>The future of this movement is bright - and it&rsquo;s all because of people like you! </p>

<p>For equality, </p>
