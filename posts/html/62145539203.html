                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Please join us at the Women, Money, Power Summit on October 8 at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.! </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited that we are bringing together such a great combination of feminist activists, experts and readers. You don&rsquo;t want to miss it, register today!

<p>The Summit is being kicked off Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. with a lively discussion on how to stop the War on Women and its attacks on everything from women&rsquo;s health to voting rights, food stamps and our wallets. The second panel of the morning will focus on some cutting-edge research on women&rsquo;s global reproductive rights. </p>

<p>At our luncheon at noon, we&rsquo;ll honor trailblazing feminists: Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D - Conn.), Texas state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, and Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyer&rsquo;s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. And that only gets us to 2 p.m.! </p>

<p>Our first afternoon summit discussion will present to attendees key strategies on ratifying the international women&rsquo;s treaty CEDAW, passing the Equal Rights Amendment, organizing on critical upcoming ballot initiatives and ending violence against women. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll wrap up with a town hall discussion on the Affordable Care Act, emphasizing what women need to know and how advocates can maximize its success. </p>

<p>Dry, I&rsquo;m sure you can see what a fantastic event this will be. 38 organizations think so too and have already signed up to be sponsors!
