<p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>This past weekend Operation Rescue/Save America started its week-long siege of clinics in New Orleans, Louisiana. I&rsquo;m writing to you from New Orleans where our Clinic Defense team is working with local officials, community leaders, and volunteer escorts to ensure protection for the clinics and doctors. </p>

<p>*We need your help to keep the city&rsquo;s two clinics open and its doctors, patients, and staff safe. * [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>

<p>Over the weekend, anti-abortion extremists distributed &ldquo;WANTED&rdquo;-style flyers featuring photos of doctors, their home addresses, and clinic information at one of the doctors&rsquo; homes. We were there to coordinate clinic defenders and monitor and record the disruptive protests. </p>

<p>Similar &ldquo;WANTED&rdquo;-style posters appeared in the early 1990s before doctors were murdered by extremists in Florida. </p>

<p>But OR/OSA&rsquo;s efforts to intimidate and threaten the doctor backfired. Outraged, the doctor&rsquo;s neighbors came out of their homes to join our clinic defenders and protest the extremists&rsquo; tactics. One quickly made and posted a big sign in their front yard that read: </p>

<p>&ldquo;WE SUPPORT FREEDOM! AND WE LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR.&rdquo; </p>

<p>So many people in New Orleans have stepped forward to lend their support and time. They are so gracious to us, and we are working so fabulously together. </p>

<p>Our work to defend abortion clinics has become even more difficult in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision striking down clinic buffer zones. *That&rsquo;s why we are asking for your support.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>

<p>After New Orleans, our team will travel to Jackson, Mississippi, for the trial of anti-abortion extremist and OR/OSA leader Chet Gallagher. Gallagher was arrested earlier at the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization, the only clinic that remains open in Mississippi. With your support, we will be there to make sure the clinic stays open when anti-abortion extremists gather for the trial. </p>

<p>*Please make a tax-deductible contribution today to support the National Clinic Access Project and our work to defend clinics.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>

P.S. Without clinics there is no choice. Please give today, we don&rsquo;t have a moment to waste in our work to keep clinics open and health care workers safe.</p>
