<p>IN THE NEWS: The Vagina Monologues &amp; the Fight Against Transphobia</p>

<p>Throughout V-Day&rsquo;s history, trans women and trans men have been<br/>
welcome to perform in The Vagina Monologues. In 2004, the first all<br/>
transgender performance occurred in Los Angeles, the result of which<br/>
was the creation of a new monologue &ldquo;They Beat The Girl Out of My<br/>
Boy&hellip;&rdquo; which has been performed at V-Day events worldwide for the<br/>
last 10 years.</p>

<p>Last week, students at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, U.S.,<br/>
decided to retire The Vagina Monologues due to their belief that the<br/>
play is not inclusive to transgender students. This has lead to a<br/>
national discussion which has played out in many media outlets, and we<br/>
wanted to take a moment to highlight some recent interviews, op-eds<br/>
and statements that speak directly to this issue.</p>

<p>Despite some inaccuracies behind the decision at Mount Holyoke, V-Day<br/>
and Eve stand in solidarity with students there in their fight against<br/>
transphobia. As Eve states in her TIME op-ed, we &ldquo;believe that this is<br/>
a beautiful opportunity to hear each other&rsquo;s stories in this<br/>
ever-evolving journey toward liberation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Vagina Monologues never intended to be a play about what it means<br/>
to be a woman. It is and always has been a play about what it means to<br/>
have a vagina. In the play, I never defined a woman as a person with a<br/>
vagina&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The responsibility of trans inclusivity is not on V-Day as an<br/>
organization or the material Eve Ensler has written. They have already<br/>
provided all the tools you need to make it inclusive. It is on each<br/>
individual production to use those tools to ensure all voices and<br/>
experiences are heard. Even the monologue that highlights transgender<br/>
women,</p>

<p>They Beat the Girl Out of My Boy, includes varied perspectives from<br/>
within the trans community across both gender expression and sexual<br/>
orientation&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Vagina Monologues, writing a transgender piece after having<br/>
intimate conversations with a diverse group of women in our community.<br/>
It debuted in 2004 as part of the first all-transgender performance,<br/>
which was cast without regard to transgender surgical status.</p>

<p>That trans-inclusive piece has been performed by trans and non-trans<br/>
participants around the world as part of V-Day&rsquo;s global fundraising<br/>
efforts to end violence against women and girls. We feel it is one of<br/>
many important steps which made the feminist movement more<br/>
trans-inclusive.</p>
