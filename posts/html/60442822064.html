                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce some of this year&rsquo;s Women, Money, Power Summit honorees: Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D - Conn.), Texas state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, and Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyer&rsquo;s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. </p>

<p>The Summit is bringing together a great combination of feminist leaders, thinkers, speakers and activists, as well as top politicians.  On Oct. 8, we&rsquo;ll have a series of panels dedicated to fighting the War on Women and an amazing luncheon. On Oct. 9, we&rsquo;ll head to Capital Hill for a Congressional lobby day. </p>

<p>We also already have 32 co-sponsoring organizations! Trust me, you won&rsquo;t want to miss miss it. [ <a href="http://feministmajority.org/women-money-power/2013WomenMoneyPower/registration.htm">http://feministmajority.org/women-money-power/2013WomenMoneyPower/registration.htm</a> ] </p>

<p>Congresswoman DeLauro has been a longtime champion of women&rsquo;s rights, pushing for equal pay and paid sick days for all. Van de Putte made national headlines in June when she stood up for women&rsquo;s reproductive rights in Texas. Arnwine is internationally renowned for contributions to civil rights and is leading the fight against voter suppression laws. </p>

<p>At a time when extremists are attempting to roll back both women&rsquo;s rights and civil rights, we&rsquo;re excited to honor three champions for social justice. </p>

<p>Dry, this is an event you will not want to miss! Grab one of the tickets before they run out. [ <a href="http://feministmajority.org/women-money-power/2013WomenMoneyPower/registration.htm">http://feministmajority.org/women-money-power/2013WomenMoneyPower/registration.htm</a> ] </p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you in October. </p>

<p>For Equality, </p>
