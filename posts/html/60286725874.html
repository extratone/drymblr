<p>V-Day Statement Against Possible U.S. Military Intervention in Syria</p>

<p>The situation in Syria is dire with 100,000 dead, over 2 million<br/>
having fled the country (half of them children), and 4.25 million<br/>
internally displaced.</p>

<p>V-Day calls on you, our community, to rise and make our voices heard<br/>
against military intervention, as such an action would simply bring<br/>
about more violence and suffering.</p>

<p>Today, we call on the U.S. to uphold the unconditional right of the<br/>
Syrian people to self-determination, and we call on the world to<br/>
oppose any U.S. military intervention in Syria. Experience shows us<br/>
that military interventions harm innocent women, men, and children.<br/>
Time and again we have seen how violence against women greatly<br/>
increases in times of military conflict.  We have seen how U.S.<br/>
interventions in the past have led to more deaths and human rights<br/>
violations against innocent people, and how aggression has not been a<br/>
solution for conflict or restoration of security.</p>

<p>Rise4Justice in Iraq: Urgent Appeal From The Organization Of<br/>
Women&rsquo;s Freedom In Iraq</p>

<p>Yanar Mohammed, President and co-founder of the Organization of<br/>
Women&rsquo;s Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), released this statement and urgent<br/>
call to action in response to the thousands of Iraqi children born<br/>
with serious birth defects caused by the humanitarian crisis created<br/>
by the U.S. military when they withdrew, and is calling for<br/>
accountability, reparations, and responsibility by the U.S.<br/>
Government.</p>

<p>Dear Friends in the global women&rsquo;s movement, human rights groups, and<br/>
political activists,</p>

<p>Thousands of Iraqi children who are less than 10 years in age have<br/>
birth defects of the same kinds. Some young Iraqi mothers have more<br/>
than one disabled child, especially if they live in the hot zones of<br/>
battles with the US troops, or around the US military bases.</p>

<p>Our fact-finding mission in 2011 found more than 350 children and<br/>
babies with the same defects in the town of Hawija. After we<br/>
publicized the news, other Hawija families contacted us, and the<br/>
number has gone to over 600-disabled children- all limbs are paralyzed<br/>
and the brains underdeveloped.</p>
