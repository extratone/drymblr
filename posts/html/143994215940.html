<p>21 Years Later And Still HealingÂ A Reflection on Performing<br/>
&ldquo;Crooked Braid&rdquo; By V-Activist Onna LeBeau</p>

<p>onnaLB.jpeg</p>

<p>After performing the spotlight monologue The Crooked Braid in a 2016<br/>
production of The Vagina Monologues, Omaha Tribe member Onna Webster<br/>
LeBeau wrote to V-Day to share her experience of participating in the<br/>
play and performing the piece for an audience full of many strong<br/>
women including many Native American women. Her blog is a reflection<br/>
on her continued path of healing and strength:</p>

<p>The Crooked Braid monologue was created after Eve Ensler interviewed<br/>
women from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in my home state of South<br/>
Dakota. &ldquo;Crooked Braid&rdquo; is the voice of many Native American women who<br/>
have been victims of domestic abuse. I am American Indian. I am an<br/>
enrolled member of the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska. For me &ldquo;Crooked Braid&rdquo;<br/>
became personal. I couldn&rsquo;t allow it to become personal. Each time I<br/>
read through the monologue I had to mentally prepare myself to allow<br/>
the voice, my voice, become the voice of the Lakota winyan (Lakota<br/>
woman), the UmoNhoN wau (Omaha woman) the voice of far too many<br/>
American Indian women. Each time I read through &ldquo;Crooked Braid&rdquo; I was<br/>
the woman told to stay home by the man who was going to go out<br/>
drinking and who knows what else. Like the woman in Crooked Braid I<br/>
was the woman who was tossed around in a parking lot like a rag doll.<br/>
I was the woman who quietly hated her husband and wished the worst<br/>
wishes ever, who feared her son(s) would inherit the abuse as the<br/>
victim and eventually the abuser.</p>
