to ratify CEDAW!* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231</a> ] </p>

Dry, </p>

<p>Exactly 34 years ago today, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was signed by then-President Jimmy Carter. 187 countries have ratified CEDAW – also known as the &ldquo;women&rsquo;s treaty&rdquo; – [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231</a> ]but the US not one of them* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231</a> ]*. That puts the US in the company of just seven countries that haven&rsquo;t taken this step to ending discrimination against women. </p>



<p>CEDAW is the only international human rights treaty focused on women&rsquo;s rights, and was adopted by the United Nations in 1979. CEDAW has since been used around the world to bolster efforts to advance the status of women and girls – including the elimination of child marriage or forced marriage, improved maternal care, reduced violence against women and sex trafficking, and increased educational opportunities. </p>

<p>It is time for the US to join the nations of the world in ratifying CEDAW and affirming the importance of equality for women and girls around the world. *Take action today to help finally ratify CEDAW [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15231</a> ].* </p>
