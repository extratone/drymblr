<p>* When I’m sketching I can’t work in silence. I draw best when I listen to BBC radio <http:>, especially crime thrillers and classic dramatizations. I become engrossed in them and my work at the same time! [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* I love Camille Walala’s Instagram feed <http:>. It’s graphic and cheerful, with a cool nod to Memphis style. I’m a sucker for all things 80s. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
