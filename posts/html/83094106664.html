<p>* I spend at least 20 minutes a day wanting to walk out of my life and into an Aran Goyoaga <http:> photograph. She effortlessly blends minimalism with color, and her use of light is unparalleled. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* I cannot stop thinking about raising quails for eggs <http:> on my (non existent) balcony. Ideas like this, plus beautiful recipes, and dreamy photography have me checking in with Edible Feast on the regular. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
