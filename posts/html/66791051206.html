<p>V-Day has set up a V-Fund to benefit women and men on the ground<br/>
immediately. 100% of donations will go directly to these efforts via<br/>
GABRIELA and Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=zY9UiLMPtfDHfvA6Qgs7WA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=zY9UiLMPtfDHfvA6Qgs7WA</a></p>

<p>. All donations made to the V-Fund will be matched. Please read the<br/>
below letters from One Billion Rising Director Monique Wilson and<br/>
V-Day Founder/Artistic Director Eve Ensler, and consider donating<br/>
whatever you can - every little bit helps.</p>

<p>From Monique in Manila:</p>

<p>As you can see from the news, the destruction from super storm Haiyan<br/>
(local name Yolanda) was on such a massive scale - the likes of which<br/>
our country has never seen before. Five million affected in the storms<br/>
path, a million homeless, 10,000 dead in one city alone (we do not<br/>
have yet the death toll from other cities and provinces), mass burials<br/>
because there were not enough body bags, corpses still hanging from<br/>
the trees or laying on the streets, entire towns wiped out and<br/>
destroyed. Two thirds of the country was hit and as of today, several<br/>
of our 7,000 islands have already gone missing from the map. And along<br/>
with that, entire towns and communities. There is another big storm<br/>
arriving on Wednesday, and reports of at least three more before<br/>
Christmas.</p>

<p>The sad news is that so many of our GABRIELA communities - rural and<br/>
peasant women, fisherfolk and farmers - especially those who lived on<br/>
the coastal towns - have been effected. Women who led the incredible<br/>
risings in these villages, towns and cities have lost families, loved<br/>
ones and lost their homes. GABRIELA is the largest grassroots based<br/>
womens alliance in the Philippines who provide direct services to<br/>
women and advocate for their rights.<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=6EM8fgAlui0dN7RRiZft_w">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=6EM8fgAlui0dN7RRiZft_w</a></p>

<p>The country is still in desperate need for help and V-Day and One<br/>
Billion Rising is calling on all of you, our Rising sisters and<br/>
brothers, to please donate what you can. V-Day has set up a V-Fund to<br/>
make donating easy and secure. 100% of the donations will go straight<br/>
to the local GABRIELA and Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party chapters to directly<br/>
benefit the people on the ground.</p>

<p>Funds raised will be used for a women&rsquo;s mission in the most affected<br/>
areas - to provide direct services - food, clothing, shelter, medical<br/>
and health needs specific to women - as well as psycho-social support<br/>
for the women survivors. In disasters, even in evacuation centers - we<br/>
know that sexual violence heightens and we need to ensure the safety<br/>
and protection of the women and girls.</p>

<p>Despite the horror, the immense sorrow and heartbreak - the Gabriela<br/>
women from the poorest communities here who have been the worst<br/>
affected - continue to inspire me. Despite having no homes, no food,<br/>
no water and nothing at all except their spirit, their will and their<br/>
hearts - they have been sending me messages to say THE RISING<br/>
CONTINUES. NOTHING WILL STOP US. They told me &ldquo;OUR RISING FOR JUSTICE<br/>
WILL BE BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN THE STORM.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank you my dearest sisters and brothers of my heart. There is much<br/>
to do - but we are moving forward. We will Rise. And we will continue<br/>
to Rise and dance in memory of everyone and everything that we have<br/>
lost - and for the future we are all dreaming for.</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping my beloved country in your embrace. It has meant<br/>
so much to us.</p>

<p>With love,<br/>
Monique</p>

<p>From Eve in Berlin:</p>

<p>Dear our most generous One Billion Rising and V-Day activists,</p>

<p>The Philippines was the site of one of the biggest risings for One<br/>
Billion Rising 2013. We need to rise for our sisters and brothers in<br/>
the Philippines now.</p>

<p>This huge crisis in the Philippines that comes as a result of climate<br/>
change, and which is a natural and human-made disaster -<br/>
connects us all. It connects us to people and to the land.</p>

<p>There are so many factors that contribute to a crisis. There is the<br/>
storm - a natural phenomenon. There is climate change. And there<br/>
are the things that we are doing to the land, like mining, that are<br/>
done out of greed. We need to look at what our countries do in the<br/>
name of profit, that affect the most vulnerable communities around the<br/>
world in times like this. When the mountains are gone because of<br/>
mining, what higher ground can people go to during a storm surge?<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=e8k_iopG9XtTwYjZU8b2Mg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=e8k_iopG9XtTwYjZU8b2Mg</a></p>

<p>All of these factors make it even more evident why we need to Rise For<br/>
Justice. Why we need to Rise right now. Why we need to Rise for the<br/>
Philippines. And in any natural or environmental disaster, it is the<br/>
women in the most marginalized, the most oppressed and impoverished<br/>
communities, who suffer the most.</p>

<p>The need to wake up to what is happening in the Philippines is a major<br/>
call for the world.</p>

<p>I have traveled the world, far and wide - but I do not know of<br/>
any organization that is as committed, as radical, as organized and as<br/>
dedicated to the women in the grassroots communities as GABRIELA<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=PgfGI5H6pKUhckfEHWRgtQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=PgfGI5H6pKUhckfEHWRgtQ</a></p>

<p>in the Philippines. They led the incredible One Billion Risings<br/>
there. They are on the ground, with the people - and every dime<br/>
you contribute will get to the women and children affected and their<br/>
families. Whatever we raise through activist donations, will get<br/>
matched.</p>

<p>With love and thanks,<br/>
Eve</p>
