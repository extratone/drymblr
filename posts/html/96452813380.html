                    <p>VSL // The New Tech City</p>

<p>* I&rsquo;m always looking for a better way to listen to audio on demand and (other than WNYC&rsquo;s own app) this new one called Overcast <http:> is pretty great; easy to navigate, nice to look at. The app comes from Marco Arment, the guy who created Instapaper and hosts his own show, Accidental Tech Podcast. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>today’s Very Short List:<br/>
tech 2 Sep 2014</p>

<p>Manoush Zomorodi hosts New York Public Radio&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Tech City <http:>,&rdquo; the show about how technology is changing human beings. Before that she worked for Reuters and the BBC and wrote a guidebook called &ldquo;Camera Ready.&rdquo; TWITTER <http:>  FACEBOOK <http:>  WEBSITE <http:></http:></http:></http:></http:></p>

<p>* Data &amp; Society <http:> calls itself &ldquo;an NYC-based think/do tank focused on social, cultural, and ethical issues arising from data-centric technological development.&rdquo; It was founded by Danah Boyd, who is such a voice of reason when it comes to parenting and tech.

<p>* Breather <http:> lets you book a sparsely furnished room by the hour in various cities. (There&rsquo;s no bed, so get your mind out of the gutter.) Just strong wifi, a whiteboard, and a yoga mat. And chairs. I like knowing peace and quiet is available on demand. &hellip;even if I never have time to use it again. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
