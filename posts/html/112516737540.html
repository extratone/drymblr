                    <p>We have educated the activists about our pro-life feminist history.</p>

<p>We have  educated the students.</p>

<p>And we have worked with university administrators during FFL Pregnancy Resource <br/>
ForumSM.</p>

<p>But  no one, not even FFL, has taken on the task of educating the educators about<br/>
our  rich, feminist history</p>
