<p>Eve&rsquo;s New Piece In The Guardian: One Billion Rising: the 2014 Campaign<br/>
to End Violence Against Women</p>

<p>Want to know why we&rsquo;re RISING for Justice in 2014? Check out the<br/>
latest piece by Eve in The Guardian, and join us on 14 February to<br/>
RISE, RELEASE, and DANCE<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=RRaRWmFeELaEY3cCVet2gA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=RRaRWmFeELaEY3cCVet2gA</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;This year we are escalating and deepening the campaign with One<br/>
Billion Rising for Justice. Justice is about restoring the primacy of<br/>
connection so that we understand that violence against women is not a<br/>
personal problem, but connected to other systemic injustices whether<br/>
they be patriarchal, economic, racial, gender, or environmental&hellip;this<br/>
year we will go further, releasing, dancing, putting our bodies on the<br/>
line with specific demands and visions that through our numbers,<br/>
solidarity and energy cannot be denied. Come rise with us.&rdquo;</p>
