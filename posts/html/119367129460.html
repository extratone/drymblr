<p>e Of Black Women And Girls Killed By<br/>
Police</p>

<p>SayHerName Vigil</p>

<p>In order to shed light on Black women&rsquo;s experiences with police<br/>
violence, the African American Policy Forum, in partnership with One<br/>
Billion Rising, BYP100, The Stop Mass Incarceration Network, Black<br/>
Lives Matter NYC, and many other community organizations will hold<br/>
ce of Black Women and Girls Killed by<br/>
the Police.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 20 at 5:30pm<br/>
Union Square South, NYC</p>

<p>For the first time, family members of Tanisha Anderson, Rekia Boyd,<br/>
Miriam Carrey, Michelle Cusseaux, Shelly Frey, and Kayla Moore are<br/>
coming together to create a space to honor their lost loved ones.</p>

<p>The event will lift up the stories of these women and recognize that<br/>
although Black women are killed, raped and beaten by the police, their<br/>
experiences are rarely foregrounded in our popular understanding of<br/>
racialized state violence.</p>

<p>The family members will be supported by community leaders and the<br/>
event will feature speaking, singing and poetry and art by Piper<br/>
Anderson, Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, Carl Dix, Eve Ensler, Sarah<br/>
Jones, LaChanze, Aja Monet, Tonya Pinkins, Sunsara Taylor and more.</p>

<p>That same day, the African American Policy Forum, in partnership with<br/>
Andrea Ritchie, a police misconduct attorney and organizer, will<br/>
release Say Her Name: The Urgent Need for a Gender Inclusive Movement<br/>
to End State Violence, a brief which will argue that the inclusion of<br/>
Black women&rsquo;s experiences is critical to effectively combating<br/>
anti-Black state violence. The brief shares the stories of Black women<br/>
who have experienced state violence, and provides some analytical<br/>
frames for understanding their experiences for the media, organizers,<br/>
researchers, policy makers and other stakeholders. The brief seeks to<br/>
broaden dominant conceptions of who victims of state violence are, and<br/>
what state violence consists of.</p>

<p>SayHerName Vigil</p>

<p>The families speaking at the vigil also have their loved ones&rsquo;<br/>
stories told in Say Her Name, some accompanied by interviews. Tanisha<br/>
Anderson, a loving mother and aspiring journalist, was forcibly<br/>
slammed to the pavement and held for an extended amount of time in a<br/>
prone position, in front of her family, before going limp and dying in<br/>
police custody. Tanisha&rsquo;s death has been ruled a homicide. Rekia<br/>
Boyd, a 22-year-old bright personality, was shot in the back of the<br/>
head by an off-duty cop who shot multiple times into an unarmed group<br/>
of friends. Miriam Carey, a young professional in the dental field,<br/>
was shot multiple times from behind while in the car with her young<br/>
daughter. Michelle Cusseaux, a caring and forgiving woman, was<br/>
unnecessarily shot and killed after the police forced their way into<br/>
her house as first responders in an effort to bring Michelle to a<br/>
mental health facility at the request of her family. Shelly Frey, the<br/>
mother of two young girls living in Houston after being displaced by<br/>
hurricane Katrina, was shot twice by an off-duty police officer in a<br/>
Walmart parking lot where he was working as a security guard. Kayla<br/>
Moore died in her apartment after police officers who arrived as first<br/>
responders to a mental health call made by her friends failed to<br/>
monitor her vital signs and provide prompt CPR after a brutal struggle<br/>
to restrain her. These deaths have gone primarily ignored, unaccounted<br/>
for and unpunished.</p>

<p>The community groups organizing the event invite all community members<br/>
to attend the vigil and to join in remembering the Black women and<br/>
girls who have been victimized by the police, but whose experiences<br/>
are all too often relegated to the margins.</p>
