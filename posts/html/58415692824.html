                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Now that it&rsquo;s time to renew your annual contribution [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10246">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10246</a> ], we want you to take pride in all the vital work your support is making possible. And more importantly, we want you to know one thing: </p>

<p>We are feminists. We are the majority. And we will win the War on Women.</p>

<p>When we stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder, we change history. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve worked to do this year. And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to continue to do with your support. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10246">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10246</a> ] </p>
