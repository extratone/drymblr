<p>From the authors of the  New York Times  bestsellers  Awkward Family Photos  and  Awkward Family Pet Photos  comes a celebration of those special times throughout the year when our families embarrass us the most &hellip; the holidays.</p>

<p><br/>
Holidays. They’re those momentous occasions when we gather with family to eat, drink, celebrate, and, of course, pose for photographs. From Mom’s homemade Halloween costumes to re-creating a Nativity scene for the Christmas card to that overly patriotic uncle who literally wears the flag on the Fourth, holidays make for humiliating memories that we carry in our hearts for years to come. Whether your family loves Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, July Fourth, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Hanukkah, this book pays homage to all of the holidays’ most uncomfortable moments.</p>
