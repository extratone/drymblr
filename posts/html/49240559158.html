<p>_Milkshake is a great place to get a daily dose of what&rsquo;s good: good in<br/>
fashion, travel, food, eco, causes, companies and incredible changemakers. _</p>

<p>_How we decide what to cover_<br/>
Picking which stories to run is often a battle of our voices because we are<br/>
all so passionate about each and every story we cover. Bottom line, we cover<br/>
what we think is inspirational. We are good at picking up trends early and<br/>
place a high value on design and communication. Our goal is that each day we<br/>
bring you something that makes you stop and think, or makes you want to look<br/>
into something a bit more, or incites you to purchase and support a cool<br/>
cause.</p>

<p>_Separation of Church and State_<br/>
We wholeheartedly believe in this and we do not ever pay for play. We only<br/>
feature what we believe in and receive no monetary benefit from any product,<br/>
company or cause that we cover. In saying that, we must pay our editorial<br/>
staff and others who help grow Milkshake. You will occasionally receive an<br/>
email that is marked &ldquo;Dedicated&rdquo; in the subject line and the email header.<br/>
These emails are paid for by our sponsors but mostly still written by us and<br/>
they promote whatever good the sponsor is doing in the world. Most companies<br/>
are doing good in some way and we are proud to feature them and encourage<br/>
you to support them.</p>

<p>_Vetting Causes_<br/>
There are so many causes in the world, some started by young kids, some that<br/>
have been around for many, many years. We research each and every cause<br/>
before running a story on it. We look to Charity Navigator and Guide Star<br/>
for accreditation.</p>

<p>_Milkshake Community_<br/>
What is most exciting to us is how Milkshake is catching on and the exposure<br/>
we are bringing to the many different products, people and places that are<br/>
doing good. That is why we started, to create a community of like-minded<br/>
people who are stimulated and excited by each story we bring them every day.<br/>
Of course some days are crazy and you just can&rsquo;t get to all the emails that<br/>
you have to open, but the great thing about Milkshake is you can always go<br/>
back open and click through the dailies you miss and still find exciting<br/>
trips that give back, restaurants that are sustainable, upcoming designers<br/>
partnering with a cause, musicians raising money for disaster relief - we<br/>
could go on and on - but you get the point.</p>

<p>_We  love</p>
