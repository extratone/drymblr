<p>One Billion Rising Activists Around the World Escalate Their Actions -<br/>
Calling for Revolution - to Decisively Demand an End to Violence<br/>
Against Women and Girls Everywhere</p>

<p>In over 200 countries, from between 14 February and 8 March<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=s0Ckdm2fYLjKwl1Md61doA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=s0Ckdm2fYLjKwl1Md61doA</a></p>

<p>(International Women&rsquo;s Day) and continuing throughout the year,<br/>
activists are Rising for Revolution - using art as a powerful form of<br/>
protest - calling for a radical shift in consciousness to demand<br/>
CHANGE and decisively end the abuse one in every three women face<br/>
worldwide.</p>

<p>The One Billion Rising energy that galvanizes and energizes local<br/>
efforts through radical creative forms of protest - has, for all the<br/>
last three years, brought attention, engagement and solidarity to the<br/>
various forms of violence women and girls experience. And while all<br/>
One Billion Rising for Revolution actions and events are locally<br/>
determined and locally led and implemented, One Billion Rising has<br/>
become, through the efforts of thousands of activists around the<br/>
world, a radical creative energy that connects the struggles and work<br/>
of local and grassroots activists into a wider global movement. It has<br/>
become a catalyst that continues to use radical creative protest to<br/>
provoke, incite, awaken, engage and educate as part of the revolution<br/>
call for change.</p>

<p>Here are a few highlights of the Revolutionary Risings creating<br/>
ripples and waves, and changes in communities around the world -<br/>
created, envisioned and driven by thousands of locally based groups in<br/>
countries across the world. See the images and stories of hope and<br/>
inspiration from the front lines of the movement:</p>

<p>Youth RISING: One Billion Rising: Revolution saw young adults, school<br/>
children, even babies brought to the front of the campaign. Thousands<br/>
of youth around the world danced to the anthem &ldquo;Break the Chain&rdquo; and<br/>
demanded access to education as a keystone of the revolution. Young<br/>
women in Mumbai flooded the streets to speak out against street<br/>
harassment. Mothers and fathers brought their children of all ages to<br/>
events and danced with them in their arms, hand in hand. In The Gambia<br/>
and Kenya, girls rose to end female genital mutilation (FGM). In<br/>
Oakland, the Radical Brownies appeared at their Artistic Uprising<br/>
evening. Girls of all ages danced, sang, expressed the feminine,<br/>
slammed poetry, and stood in solidarity.</p>

<p>Rise for the Raise, Workers Rising: The demand for economic security,<br/>
ending workplace sexual harassment, stronger labor laws and fair wages<br/>
was amplified my multiple risings this year. We saw women demanding an<br/>
end to the exploitative contractualization of labor and unfair working<br/>
conditions. Restaurant workers and customers who support<br/>
called on legislators to raise the minimum wage and on CEOs to pay<br/>
workers a livable wage in the U.S. One Billion Rising joined ROC<br/>
United to get the word out about a series of actions on this issue. On<br/>
13, February, a national action in the United States took place on<br/>
ROC&rsquo;s annual day of action.</p>

<p>Breaking the Silence: Every year we see the power of releasing<br/>
stories, releasing pain and trauma, and the healing power of a<br/>
community coming together to hold the space for testimonials. This<br/>
year sex trafficking survivors spoke out in defiance of their captors,<br/>
veterans denounced the continued culture of denial of sexual abuse in<br/>
the US military, and survivors shared their My Revolution stories<br/>
online.</p>

<p>Men Rising: This year, men led and organized groundbreaking,<br/>
revolutionary initiatives, serving as an inspiration for other men<br/>
around the world to be part of the radical shift in consciousness in<br/>
how women and girls are treated and seen on the community and global<br/>
level.</p>
