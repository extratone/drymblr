                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Today, Ms. co-founder Gloria Steinem received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, the highest award a citizen can be given. </p>

<p>Dry, congratulate Gloria today by signing her card. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=14621">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=14621</a> ] </p>

<p>At a special luncheon honoring Gloria on Monday at the National Press Club, an audience member asked what message she would most like to impart on young women. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what she said: </p>

<p>&ldquo;People often ask me at this age, &lsquo;Who am I passing the torch to?&rsquo; First of all, I&rsquo;m not giving up my torch, thank you! I&rsquo;m using my torch to light other people&rsquo;s torches. â€¦ If we each have a torch, there&rsquo;s a lot more light.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Together with Gloria&rsquo;s leadership, we&rsquo;ve accomplished so much over the last 40 years, but there&rsquo;s still much left to do. With your support today, we can keep lighting the torch that Gloria started so many years ago. Join the Ms. community today.

<p>For women&rsquo;s equality, </p>
