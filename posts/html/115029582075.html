<p>* Ditch the caffeine, and go for the bone broth. Bone Deep and Harmony <http:>&rsquo;s broth is available for pick-up or delivery in NYC, with online ordering coming soon. There&rsquo;s also Brodo <http:>, a to-go bone broth spot in the East Village. I recommend adding fresh turmeric or shiitake mushroom tea. (image <http:>) [3 of 3]</http:></http:></http:></p>
