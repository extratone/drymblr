                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Our National Young Feminist Leadership Conference Congressional Visit Day is a chance for activists from around the country to talk to their representatives about the issues that matter most to them. We&rsquo;ll have a briefing with leaders in the morning, and then you will visit with your representatives and senators in the afternoon.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one way to get to Congressional Visit Day: *Register for the National Young Feminist Leadership Conference today!
