Sudanese V-Activists, lead by One Billion Rising global coordinator<br/>
Fahima Hashim, Director for Salmmah Women&rsquo;s Resource Centre, released<br/>
this incredible video of their nation-wide One Billion Rising campaign<br/>
for JUSTICE! The powerful footage reminds us that incredible work is<br/>
being done every day on the ground by activists in their communities.<br/>
Women, men, youth and children come together to address justice in<br/>
Sudan and share their voices, their art, and their dance with the<br/>
ongoing global movement to end violence against women and girls. This<br/>
is what justice looks like!</p>
