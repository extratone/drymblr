<p>By Serrin M. Foster, FFL President<br/>
Former Congresswoman and Ambassador Lindy Boggs died Saturday July 27, 2013, at <br/>
the age of 97. She lived a most remarkable life.<br/>
Born Marie Corrine Morrison Claiborne in Louisiana on March 13, 1916, she was later<br/>
nicknamed &ldquo;Rolindy&rdquo; because she resembled her father Roland, who died when she was<br/>
just two years old. But eventually people came to know her as &ldquo;Lindy.&rdquo;<br/>
Boggs&rsquo; ancestors served in Congress during both the 18th and 19th centuries. She<br/>
 was a descendant of the state&rsquo;s first governor, William C.C. Claiborne, and second<br/>
cousin to deLesseps Story &ldquo;Chep&rdquo; Morrison, Sr., Mayor of New Orleans from 1946 to<br/>
1961. Politics was in her blood.<br/>
Lindy Boggs was a teacher when she married Thomas Hale Boggs, Sr., a lawyer and <br/>
former classmate at Tulane University who was first elected to Congress in 1940.<br/>
 She was just 24 when she arrived in Washington, D.C. She served as his campaign<br/>
 manager, staffer, and top political advisor. &ldquo;Early on, Hale established with politicians<br/>
at home that I was his direct representative and that they could say anything to<br/>
 me that they could say to him. Whatever decisions I made, they would be his final<br/>
decisions,&rdquo; she recalled.<br/>
In October 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, along with Representative Nick<br/>
Begich, an aide, and their pilot, disappeared while traveling over a remote section<br/>
of Alaska en route to a fundraiser for Begich. Three months later, the House declared<br/>
his seat vacant. Boggs (and Begich) won election posthumously. On January 12, Lindy<br/>
Boggs announced her candidacy for her late husband&rsquo;s seat saying, &ldquo;I know the job<br/>
and am humbled by its proportions.&rdquo;<br/>
Ten days later, the U.S. Supreme Court would announce its landmark decision, Roe<br/>
 v. Wade.<br/>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only widow I know who is really qualified - damn qualified - to take <br/>
over,&rdquo; barked the cantankerous Armed Services Chairman F. Edward Hébert of Louisiana.<br/>
Boggs won the special election in a landslide victory. Shortly after the election,<br/>
she was asked if she had any doubts about running for her husband&rsquo;s former office.<br/>
She quipped, &ldquo;The only thing that almost stopped me was that I didn&rsquo;t know how I<br/>
 could do it without a wife.&rdquo;<br/>
Boggs became the first woman to represent Louisiana in the House of Representatives.<br/>
It was only one of many firsts.<br/>
Representative Boggs helped to write the Employment Credit Opportunity Act of 1974<br/>
and held seats on the powerful House Appropriations Committee and the Select Committee<br/>
on Children, Youth, and Families.<br/>
Among her most noted accomplishments was personally marking up the Equal Credit <br/>
Opportunity Act of 1974. Representative Boggs appreciated that it prohibited discrimination<br/>
on the basis of &ldquo;race and age, and their status as veterans.&rdquo; But as a new widow<br/>
 who had to manage her own finances, she decided to expand protection for women.<br/>
 Without informing other members on the Committee, she said, &ldquo;I ran into a room <br/>
where there was a copying machine, wrote in &lsquo;sex and marital status&rsquo; on the bill,<br/>
and made 47 copies.&rdquo;  After distributing the copies, she explained to her colleagues<br/>
in her Southern drawl, &ldquo;Knowing the members composing this committee as well as <br/>
I do, I&rsquo;m sure it was just an oversight that we didn&rsquo;t have 'sex&rsquo; or 'marital status&rsquo;<br/>
included. I&rsquo;ve taken care of that, and trust it meets with the committee&rsquo;s approval.&rdquo;<br/>
It passed unanimously, 47-0. She was a freshman legislator at the time.<br/>
In 1977, Boggs helped co-found the Congressional Women&rsquo;s Caucus. She considered <br/>
herself a champion of women&rsquo;s issues. &ldquo;Almost all women&rsquo;s issues are economic issues,<br/>
a stunning idea to those persons who want to hear about 'Great Women&rsquo;s Issues&rsquo; and<br/>
expect us to be preoccupied with the ERA or abortion or sexual harassment.&rdquo; She <br/>
explained, &ldquo;The major issues of importance that I&rsquo;ve worked for are economic ones:<br/>
equal rights for women in business, banking, and home ownership; the promotion of<br/>
women in the workplace; better jobs in government contracts; and equal opportunities<br/>
for higher education, especially in science and medicine.&rdquo;<br/>
While Boggs did not see abortion as the top issue for women, the pro-life Democrat<br/>
consistently voted against abortion and for women. Most famously, in 1977 she and<br/>
five other women out of 18 voted &ldquo;Aye&rdquo; for the Hyde Amendment, which to this day<br/>
 bars Medicaid funding for most abortions.<br/>
Few could have predicted that a Louisianan born and raised on a plantation would<br/>
 become a fierce advocate of civil rights. But Boggs understood that civil rights<br/>
were an inseparable part of the political reform movement of the 1940s and '50s.<br/>
 Among her accomplishments was working for the passage of the Civil Rights Acts <br/>
of 1965 and 1968. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t want to reverse the injustices of the political <br/>
system and not include the blacks and the poor. It was just obvious,&rdquo; she said.<br/>
Boggs was the only white representing a black-majority district in Congress when<br/>
 she announced her retirement in 1990. &ldquo;I am proud to have played a small role in<br/>
opening doors for blacks and women,&rdquo; she said at the time.<br/>
In another sign of her trailblazing career, Representative Boggs was the first woman<br/>
to chair a major political party&rsquo;s presidential nominating convention. At the 1976<br/>
Democratic National Convention in New York, she decreed that she would be addressed<br/>
as &ldquo;Madam Chairwoman,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Madam Chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Madam Chairperson.&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a woman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why should it be neuter?&rdquo;<br/>
In 1984, she was on the shortlist of names considered for Vice President. &ldquo;[The <br/>
party&rsquo;s] confidence was pleasing, but I knew that my age and feelings regarding <br/>
abortion&hellip; would preclude any serious consideration of me,&rdquo; she later recalled.<br/>
 &ldquo;I stayed within the mainstream of the consideration and talked to various groups,<br/>
never about myself but always about the fact that a woman could be President or <br/>
Vice President. I wanted people to remain interested in the possibility.&rdquo;<br/>
During a 1987 National Right to Life Convention, the pro-life feminist invited Feminists<br/>
for Life&rsquo;s leadership to her home in New Orleans.<br/>
While a family tragedy marked her start in Congress, another painful loss accompanied<br/>
her exit. Lindy Boggs announced her retirement after learning that her daughter <br/>
Barbara Boggs Sigmund, mayor of Princeton, N.J., was dying of cancer. Sigmund finally<br/>
succumbed to it in October 1990.<br/>
A lifelong pro-life Democrat, she retired in 1991, after nine terms in office. She<br/>
never faced a serious political challenge for her seat in Congress.<br/>
That same year, a reading room set aside for female Members of Congress was named<br/>
the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Women&rsquo;s Reading Room. According to a U.S.<br/>
House historian, it is the only room in the building named for a woman.<br/>
Her retirement was premature. Six years later, she answered another call when President<br/>
Bill Clinton asked Representative Boggs to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.<br/>
Her daughter, ABC News journalist Cokie Roberts, described the hearing as a &ldquo;love<br/>
fest,&rdquo; with friends and colleagues in the Senate filling their time with praise <br/>
for the octogenarian.<br/>
At age 81, she became the first American woman to hold the diplomatic position. <br/>
She served from 1997 until 2001.<br/>
Feminists for Life named her a Remarkable Pro-Life Woman® in 1998.<br/>
In 2001, Congress honored her for her &ldquo;extraordinary service&rdquo; on the occasion of<br/>
 the 25th anniversary of the Congressional Women&rsquo;s Caucus.<br/>
As a U.S. Senate spouse, Susan Hurley DeConcini traveled in the same political circles<br/>
in Washington as Boggs. Later, DeConcini served as a member of Feminists for Life<br/>
of America&rsquo;s Board of Directors, and in anticipation of a 2004 Board meeting in <br/>
New Orleans, DeConcini invited her friend Lindy to a private dinner hosted by FFL&rsquo;s<br/>
Board of Directors at Antoine&rsquo;s Restaurant in New Orleans.<br/>
I remember how excited we were when Susie told us that she had accepted our invitation<br/>
to hold a dinner in her honor. You knew immediately that Ambassador Boggs was New<br/>
Orleans royalty, and if you didn&rsquo;t know it already, everyone in the restaurant and<br/>
on our walk after dinner to her home in the French Quarter made it clear.<br/>
As we made our way through the carriage entrance under the house to the center of<br/>
the courtyard, she stopped to explain the layout of the grounds. As she stood next<br/>
to her fountain, she told us that she inherited the property from an aunt. Soon <br/>
after, she arranged for the removal of a dying tree. The landscaper called to assure<br/>
her that although he couldn&rsquo;t find the key to the gate, they scaled the wall and<br/>
 removed the tree. Horrified, she replied, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have a gate!&rdquo;<br/>
The Ambassador gave us a private tour of her historic 18th century Bourbon Street<br/>
home and her treasured family and political mementos - many were one and the same.<br/>
Her canopied bed rivaled those in palaces in Europe. She was living in a museum.<br/>
Ambassador Boggs told us that her children were nervous about her living alone on<br/>
Bourbon Street, but it was apparent that the strength of this woman and the genuine<br/>
love and admiration felt by the people of New Orleans meant that if anyone should<br/>
cause her harm, they should be the ones who should be nervous.<br/>
The following year, Ambassador Boggs survived Hurricane Katrina, as did her historic<br/>
home. When she decided to relocate closer to family in the Washington, D.C. area,<br/>
her daughter Cokie Roberts and son Thomas Hale Boggs, an influential lobbyist and<br/>
lawyer, got their wishes.<br/>
The recipient of countless local and national honors, she was awarded the Congressional<br/>
Distinguished Service Award in 2006 for her time in the House of Representatives.<br/>
Most recently, she returned to her beloved city in October 2011 for the funeral <br/>
of her longtime friend and colleague, retired Archbishop Philip Hannan, most famous<br/>
for &ldquo;marrying and burying the Kennedys.&rdquo;<br/>
Her daughter remembers her mother as &ldquo;a trailblazer for women and the disadvantaged.&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;I never expected that I would develop my own agenda or that I would become a voice<br/>
and a vote for many women during two tumultuous decades,&rdquo; Ambassador Boggs wrote<br/>
 in her 1994 memoir, Washington Through a Purple Veil: Memoirs of a Southern Woman,<br/>
co-authored by Katherine Hatch.<br/>
Upon learning of her friend&rsquo;s passing, former FFL Board member Susan DeConcini said,<br/>
&ldquo;I admired Lindy Boggs because she was a woman who tried to help other women succeed<br/>
in the work world and in raising their economic circumstances. In addition to these<br/>
causes, she was always pro-life, which I believe is the definition of being a feminist.<br/>
What is more feminine than having a baby and nurturing the baby to adulthood? She<br/>
and I were on the same page on this subject. She was a role model for many women,<br/>
including me.&rdquo;<br/>
In addition to her children, Boggs is survived by eight grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.<br/>
&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;</p>
