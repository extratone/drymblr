                                    <h1>Urgent: Join us to defeat abortion ban ballot measure</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>As the leaders of major reproductive rights organizations, we&rsquo;re emailing you together because the situation in Albuquerque, NM is urgent. A measure to ban abortions at 20 weeks is on the November 19 city special election ballot. This measure is dangerous for Albuquerque women and families. </p>

<p>The ballot measure, if approved, would allow the city government to interfere with a private decision between a woman, her family and her doctor. The measure contains no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the woman. </p>

<p>We need your help to defeat this extreme city ballot measure - please make an emergency contribution today.  [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ] </p>

<p>Your contribution will go to the Respect ABQ Women [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ], a group of women, families, and allied organizations building a grassroots campaign to defeat the City of Albuquerque ballot measure that would mandate government interference in a woman&rsquo;s decision about abortion. Partners of the campaign include Planned Parenthood of New Mexico, Young Women United, Strong Families Moving Forward, ACLU-NM, League of Women Voters of New Mexico, National Organization for Women, NM Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Feminist Majority Campus Groups, NM, and many more groups. </p>

<p>The ban was championed by Operation Rescue. We cannot let groups - whose real agenda is to ban abortion altogether - endanger women&rsquo;s lives. We must not embolden extreme groups like Operation Rescue. </p>

<p>Will you join us today to help stop them? [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ] </p>

<p>If this city ordinance is approved, it could have far reaching and alarming consequences. We must not be forced to fight city by city, state by state for women&rsquo;s right to make these personal health decisions. These deeply private decisions must stay with those best suited to make them - a woman in consultation with her loved ones and her doctor. </p>

<p>Dry, we are counting on you [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ]. [ <a href="https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate">https://respectabqwomen.nationbuilder.com/donate</a> ] In just the past two years, you have helped us defeat anti-abortion ballot measures in Mississippi, North Dakota, and Florida. And now with your help, we can also defeat this dangerous Albuquerque ballot measure and stop this city ordinance strategy in its tracks. </p>
