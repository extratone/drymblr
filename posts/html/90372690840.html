Women&rsquo;s Rights Groups Demand that U.S. Stop Negotiating TPP with Brunei Until the Sultan Revokes New Taliban-Like Laws </p>

<p><br/>
WASHINGTON – A coalition of women&rsquo;s rights groups have joined the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) in calling for the Obama Administration to initiate the process of removing Brunei from negotiations on a prospective Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with the United States – or to suspend TPP talks – until Brunei revokes its new Taliban-like penal code.</p>

<p><br/>
&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s rights and human rights cannot take a backseat to profit and trade,&rdquo; said FMF President Eleanor Smeal. &ldquo;As a global leader, the United States should not negotiate a free trade agreement with a country that has enacted laws hostile to basic human rights and dignity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br/>
Twelve women&rsquo;s rights organizations – including FMF, American Association of University Women, the Clearinghouse on Women&rsquo;s Issues, the Institute for Science and Human Values, Jewish Women International, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Council of Jewish Women, the National Organization for Women, the Women&rsquo;s Global Program of the Communications Consortium Media Center, Women&rsquo;s Online Media and Education Network, and the U.S. National Committee for UN Women – delivered a letter to the White House expressing outrage over Brunei&rsquo;s new penal code and asking the Administration stop negotiating the TPP with Brunei.</p>

<p><br/>
The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a proposed regional free trade agreement being negotiated between the U.S. and Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The TPP addresses a broad range of issues, including trade in goods and services; regulation of intellectual property and foreign investments; as well as labor and environmental rules, among other topics. TPP negotiations have been ongoing since 2010, with very little information about the negotiated documents released to Congress or to the public.</p>

<p><br/>
&ldquo;The U.S. must insist that Brunei address human rights concerns by revoking its penal code before the U.S. continues negotiations with Brunei on the TPP,&rdquo; continued Smeal. &ldquo;There is simply no place in a civilized society for kill-a-gay and flog-a-woman penal codes. Our foreign policy should make that clear, especially in the execution of our trade agreements.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br/>
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights has expressed deep concern about Brunei&rsquo;s new penal code and stated that its draconian punishments would violate international law. The new penal code, which went into effect on May 1, is set to be implemented in three phases. The first phase includes fines and prison sentences for such &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; as becoming pregnant outside of marriage. The second phase includes corporal punishment, such as amputations and flogging of women who have abortions. The third phase includes the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians and those convicted of adultery.</p>

<p><br/>
FMF has launched a petition drive and social media campaig calling on the Sultan of Brunei to revoke the new penal code [ <a href="http://bit.ly/StopTheSultan">http://bit.ly/StopTheSultan</a> ], and together with Mavis and Jay Leno, held a rally in Los Angeles, California on May 5 across from the Beverly Hills Hotel – part of the Dorchester Collection of properties, owned by the Sultan – to protest the law.  </p>
