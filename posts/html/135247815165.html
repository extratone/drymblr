<p>As 2015 comes to a close, we wish to share these recent updates on the<br/>
achievements of City of Joy and the V-World Farm this year.</p>

<p>It is a report that comes as a result of people like you who care<br/>
deeply about our work. It gives hope, activates our energy to serve,<br/>
and lets us keep going in our vision to Transform Pain to Power. The<br/>
88 women who graduated in June are the seeds of the revolution we need<br/>
to make change happen in the history of the DR Congo. The work is<br/>
being recognized. Recently both VICE and Time magazine came to visit<br/>
City of Joy for upcoming stories on rape in conflict zones.</p>

<p>It is with the great help of our big V-family, our V-friends and our<br/>
donors that all these achievements are carried out at the center of<br/>
madness where survivors of gender violence turn into brave, stunning<br/>
women. May all of YOU receive our thanks and heartfelt gratitude!</p>

<p>Happiest holidays wishes to you and yours,<br/>
Christine &amp; Eve</p>

<p>CITY OF JOY</p>

<p>Despite the many challenges facing Congo  ongoing conflict, increased<br/>
violence against women, weather and infrastructure challenges - City<br/>
of Joy is thriving. To date seven classes, totaling 579 women, have<br/>
graduated from the program. The City of Joy continues to serve as a<br/>
center for leadership development where women are transforming their<br/>
painful pasts into fuel for personal and emotional success, learning<br/>
real, practical life skills to map out their goals and hopes. At the<br/>
same time, the City of Joy stands as a powerful symbol for the<br/>
Congolese people. As one community leader told our staff, the City of<br/>
Joy is unique because it is focused not on the urgent and immediate<br/>
needs of survivors (addressing medical needs, etc.), but because it<br/>
focuses on the long-term leadership capacities of women and the role<br/>
they will play in the future of Congolese society. City of Joy staff<br/>
continues to be in close contact with classes that have left, and they<br/>
too are doing well, integrating into their communities.</p>

<p>SEVENTH GRADUATION!</p>

<p>On June 4, City of Joy graduated 88 women and girls of the seventh<br/>
session in an extraordinary ceremony. Among the participants we had<br/>
the Governor of South-Kivu province, local authorities, parents of<br/>
graduates, members of partner associations/organizations, and many<br/>
other guests.</p>

<p>The graduation day was a day in which every woman celebrated herself.<br/>
It was a day to tell how City of Joy is an engine of transformation in<br/>
which they lived for six months to turn into brave, beautiful, and<br/>
strong women leaders. The change  physical, emotional, intellectual,<br/>
etc.  was something the audience noticed in the face and in the life<br/>
of every woman. Many parents and associations who referred women to us<br/>
were unable to identify these women because of their healing and<br/>
change. Read the full report here.<br/>

<p>TURNING PAIN TO POWER TO PLANTING</p>

<p>City of Joy&rsquo;s sister project, the V-World Farm, is a bustling<br/>
sustainable farm 30 minutes from the City of Joy. It serves as<br/>
teaching opportunity for women participants  who learn about farming -<br/>
and helps to feed the City of Joy. The project has grown leaps and<br/>
bounds since it was first conceived. Crops abound - honey bee hives,<br/>
avocados, oranges, pineapples, guavas, maize, string beans, cabbage,<br/>
celery, carrots amaranth, beans, sweet potatoes, ground nuts,<br/>
eggplants and tomatoes. The tilapia ponds are brimming with fish,<br/>
which will help to feed the women at City of Joy and will soon be<br/>
sold. Thirty tons of rice was harvested and selling the harvest of<br/>
rice from the year before paid for the new rice machine.<br/>

<p>Twenty thousand new trees have been planted along the border of the<br/>
property and more will be planted in the upcoming months. Construction<br/>
of houses for women who will live and work at V-World is underway.<br/>
Upon completion, we will be able to house 40 women. These women will<br/>
begin to form the basis for the collective that we hope will one day<br/>
run and own V-World Farm. View more photos here.<br/>

<p>ROADS!</p>

<p>Here is a photo of Essence Road (the main thoroughfare out to City of<br/>
Joy and Panzi Hospital) recently in the rain juxtaposed with an image<br/>
of our newest roads at V-World Farm! The completion of these new roads<br/>
and bridges at V-World Farm took place over the past few months.<br/>
Infrastructure is critical to the farm as it makes it more accessible<br/>
to jeeps and cars which bring in supplies and ship out produce and<br/>
farm products. To see more images, visit the photo blog.<br/>

<p>CONGO RISING, GREEN REVOLUTION</p>

<p>The rising which launched in November 2015 coincided with The Official<br/>
16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign with the theme<br/>
&ldquo;From Peace in the Home to Peace in the World: Make Education Safe for<br/>
All!&rdquo; It is a campaign that focuses specifically on the relationship<br/>
between militarism and the right to education in situations of violent<br/>
conflict, in relative peace, and variety of education settings, while<br/>
continuing to make the links with militarism, as an encompassing<br/>
patriarchal system of discrimination and inequality based on our<br/>
relationships to power. It will be launched in the V-World Farm,Â­ a<br/>
farm that proves that a new world is possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=CEkOKsdc1rWclv_Ca4xnXg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=CEkOKsdc1rWclv_Ca4xnXg</a><br/>

<p>The rising in DRC in 2016 will bring &ldquo;THE GREEN REVOLUTION&rdquo; into<br/>
focus. Since we started rising and standing in solidarity with women<br/>
across the world who experience violence in general and those from DRC<br/>
who have experienced great losses including loss of lives, rape,<br/>
kidnapping, incest, etc., we need the humanity and the Congo to bring<br/>
national and international focus to another aspect that needs<br/>
revolution and for which we are determined to invite people to rise<br/>
and create a new kind of consciousness through resistance and action.</p>

<p>The campaign of One Billion Rising Revolution: Listen! Act! Rise! 2016<br/>
will get inspiration from the paradox of life in the Congo that needs<br/>
to be revolutionized.</p>

<p>From East to West and from South to North, DR Congo is a paradox, in<br/>
that it is rich in natural resources yet is one of the poorest<br/>
countries in the world. Its population has to put up with violence,<br/>
disease, hunger and the mass displacement of people caused by more or<br/>
less two decades of wars and cross-border conflicts. With impunity,<br/>
political impotence, conflicts over natural resources which have<br/>
continually flared, East Congo has remained a hotbed of all forms of<br/>
violence.</p>

<p>In 2016, we will tell the DRC and the planet that it is high time for<br/>
Congolese to bring change and improve their lands, benefit from their<br/>
forests by keeping bees to produce honey, plowing their lands to<br/>
become agricultural entrepreneurs, breeding animals for economic<br/>
empowerment, planting trees to nourish and protect Mother Nature. We<br/>
will raise the consciousness of rich persons who after buying large<br/>
lands from poor persons lay them fallow for years and leave the poor<br/>
to starve and die from hunger. It will be an opportunity for GREEN<br/>
REVOLUTION!</p>

<p>In solidarity!</p>
