<p>* The Red Bull Cold Rush <http:> in Canada coming up this February is one of the premier peer-judged ski competitions <http:> because it combines some of the steepest and most challenging terrain with the world’s best backcountry skiers.

<p>* I’ve always wanted to visit the Tordillo Mountain Lodge in Alaska for their “Cast and Carve” excursion <http:>. You catch 35-50 pound king salmon and heli-ski in the sunshine. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* The FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup just took place last weekend at Deer Valley. The aerial finals <http:> is one of the events that inspires me to push myself every time I’m on the slopes. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
