<p>With Thanks, We Share Our 2013 Annual Report!<br/>
ONE BILLION RISING</p>

<p>Dear V-Activists,</p>

<p>The end of the most extraordinary year is almost upon us! Together<br/>
with you, our amazing global team of activists, we created the largest<br/>
mass action to end violence against women and girls in the history of<br/>
humankind.<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=SmnudS-cpCf8CNUEHXET5g">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=SmnudS-cpCf8CNUEHXET5g</a></p>

<p>V-Day&rsquo;s 15th anniversary year was unprecedented in every respect. One<br/>
Billion women, men, and youth in 207 countries were inspired to<br/>
STRIKE, RISE, and DANCE to end violence against women and girls.<br/>
Record numbers of V-Day events were produced. The fourth class of<br/>
women graduated from the City of Joy and returned to their communities<br/>
with confidence, skills and knowledge to lead. Safe houses, rape<br/>
crises centers and sexual assault campus programs kept their doors<br/>
open despite government shut downs and long odds, laws in many<br/>
countries were changed, and the Violence Against Women Act was<br/>
reauthorized in the US.</p>
