<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>What happens when a mother loses custody to the state?</p>

<p><br/>
Thanks to rigid child welfare laws, she may one day never see her kid again. </p>

<p>Poor mothers struggling to raise their children are at greater risk of having them taken by the state and put into the foster care system. These mothers need support, but even after a mother gets back on her feet, she may still lose her parental rights forever, and her child may lose the only chance at a legal relationship to a family.</p>



<p><br/>
But now family advocates are calling for reform that would introduce more pathways to reunify parents with their children. </p>

<p> [ <a href="http://msmagazine.com/summer2014/index.asp">http://msmagazine.com/summer2014/index.asp</a> ]*Our latest issue of &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo;* [ <a href="http://msmagazine.com/summer2014/index.asp">http://msmagazine.com/summer2014/index.asp</a> ] makes the case for revamped laws that recognize the need for parental presence in a child&rsquo;s life. *Get the full story when you subscribe today!
