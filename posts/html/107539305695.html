                    <p>Hey Dry! </p>



<p>We hope you had a great holiday season and are ready to hit the ground running this year! We need you to *TAKE ACTION NOW* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] to help fight multiple anti-abortion measures being introduced in the Tennessee legislature NEXT WEEK. With new power to regulate abortion as a result of the narrow passage of Amendment 1 - a dangerous amendment in the state that strips privacy protections from the state constitution that prevented extreme abortion restrictions - Republicans plan to take up multiple anti-abortion measures: mandatory counseling and forced ultrasounds not more than 72 hours before or less than 24 hours before the abortion. </p>



<p> [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] </p>



<p>The Feminist Majority Campus Team has developed *a digital petition* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] to go to Governor Bill Haslam, Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey, and House Speaker Beth Harwell, imploring them to respect women&rsquo;s rights and to exercise restraint so Tennessee women have comprehensive access to modern health care without harassment and undue burden. We want to challenge all of you to get as many signatures as possible from people in your communities. *We&rsquo;ve posted the petition online [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TNpetition1.pdf">http://feministcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TNpetition1.pdf</a> ]* for people nationwide to sign in a show of solidarity.  </p>
