<p>GABRIELA Awarded the Hildegarde Award for Outstanding Developmental<br/>
Campaign in the Philippines for the One Billion Rising 2013 Campaign</p>

<p>GABRIELA is a nationwide alliance of more than 200 women&rsquo;s<br/>
organizations that cut across sectors and regions, plus chapters and<br/>
support groups of Filipinas and non-Filipinas in various continents of<br/>
the world now celebrating its 30th year. The GABRIELA National<br/>
Alliance of Women - considered the most militant women&rsquo;s movement in<br/>
the Philippines, is a grassroots-based alliance of women all over the<br/>
Philippines and Philippine groups around the world, seeking to wage a<br/>
struggle for the liberation of all Filipino women and girls who are<br/>
oppressed, exploited and abused. They organize women especially from<br/>
the sectors of farmers, workers, urban poor and students, and<br/>
vigorously campaign on women-specific issues such as women&rsquo;s rights,<br/>
discrimination, violence against women, women&rsquo;s health and<br/>
reproductive rights. GABRIELA is also at the forefront of national and<br/>
international economic and political issues that affect women. At the<br/>
same time, GABRIELA provides actual direct services for marginalized<br/>
women through its National Office, provincial and regional centers and<br/>
member institutions. GABRIELA led the One Billion Rising Philippines<br/>
campaigns in the Philippines and within Filipino migrant communities<br/>
in 22 countries in 2013 and 2014, forming a multi-sectoral task force<br/>
group made up of women workers, urban poor women, fisher women,<br/>
peasant women, students, comfort women of World War 2, teachers,<br/>
church women, artists, and migrant women and their families - bringing<br/>
to the forefront the issues of militarisation, state neglect, rapes by<br/>
men in uniform and by men in authority, human and sex trafficking,<br/>
forced migration, labor export policies, exploitation of women<br/>
workers, indigenous women&rsquo;s issues, women&rsquo;s health, among many others.<br/>
On October 28, 2000, the Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party was founded as an<br/>
offshoot of GABRIELA, and GABRIELA leaders have been sitting as<br/>
Congressional representatives since then - continuing the fight for<br/>
the Filipina women&rsquo;s demand for social justice, equality, freedom and<br/>
democracy.</p>
