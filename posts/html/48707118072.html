<p>UPDATE from City of Joy - Third Class Graduates!</p>

<p>V-Day Congo &amp; City of Joy Director Christine Schuler Deschryver<br/>
shares with us news from City of Joy ( <a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=pN9kncNWxe2Hvn5dfOmbhw">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=pN9kncNWxe2Hvn5dfOmbhw</a> )<br/>
and third class of graduates:</p>

<p>It is hard to put into words what the graduation yesterday was like -<br/>
it is just beyond words, the transformation of the girls and the<br/>
children is so radical. Many people attended, most of them from civil<br/>
society. Dr. Mukwege also came with lots of his visitors and I don&rsquo;t<br/>
remember seeing him so proud and happy. He did an amazing speech<br/>
glorifying our work, and the girls.</p>

<p>Girls were radiant and extremely proud to show everything they learned<br/>
at City of Joy. Theatre and songs were used. Some of my favorite<br/>
Congolese actors here surprised me by coming and played the role of a<br/>
wife coming back home after being raped, healed at Panzi hospital and<br/>
trained at City Of Joy. It was just excellent.</p>

<p>Let me thank all of you for your support to make this happen. As I<br/>
told Eve, my strength here is my friendship with her and all your<br/>
love. It is more and more difficult to work here - problems coming<br/>
from everywhere, challenges everyday. We have to go on knowing we are<br/>
doing our best, trying to bring brighter days in the darkness of DR<br/>
Congo. You cannot change the world without love.</p>

<p>Social workers left this morning for new recruitment and we will start<br/>
our new session on May 2nd. A lot of preparation work to do before the<br/>
new group arrives.</p>

<p>Blessings and gratitude to all of you,</p>

<p>Christine Schuler Deschryver<br/>

<p>ONE BILLION RISING<br/>
by Purva Panday Cullman, Programs &amp; Development Director<br/>
One Billion Rising was a unique experience for me.  In the months<br/>
leading up to it I was part of the team planning and executing some of<br/>
the events and projects that helped build momentum for the campaign -<br/>
from our Africa Summit in Nairobi to the NYC Break The Chains flashmob<br/>
and video shoot, to helping to bring on diverse partners like the<br/>
Guerrilla Girls and the National Domestic Workers Alliance.<br/>

<p>SOWETO RISING<br/>
by Stacey Rozen, Regional Coordinator<br/>
Still reeling from the horrific gang rape and murder of 17-year-old<br/>

<p>NYC RISING<br/>
by Rachel P. Goldstein, Regional Coordinator<br/>
One billion women and girls are raped, abused, or beaten in their<br/>
lifetime.  That statistic was the driving force behind the efforts of<br/>
myself and my team as we passionately took on Eve Ensler and her One<br/>
Billion Rising campaign to stop this senselessness.<br/>
