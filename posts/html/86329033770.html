<p>City of Joy Update: Fifth Class Graduates!</p>

<p>V-Day Congo Director/Director of City of Joy Christine Schuler<br/>
Deschryver updates us about the fifth graduating class of City of Joy:</p>

<p>On 5 May 2014, we ended our 5th training session with an extraordinary<br/>
ceremony, which included members of Panzi Foundation DRC and the<br/>
Chairman of the board, Dr. Denis Mukwege. Partners from the grassroots<br/>
associates were also present, along with past graduates who came to<br/>
participate in their sisters&rsquo; victory and healing from their traumas.<br/>

<p>Our 5th session graduates organized the ceremony themselves with<br/>
testimonies regarding their radical change in their lifestyle. They<br/>
testified that they have begun to boldly do things which they could<br/>
previously never have thought of doing. A woman from the Banyamulenge<br/>
tribe explained fearlessly that she arrived at City of Joy with a<br/>
broken, sullied health filled with hatred inherited from the violence<br/>
she survived in her village. She could not sleep and completely<br/>
isolated herself for years, she added. At City of Joy, she learned<br/>
what LOVE and SHARING are. These are the only easy solutions she has<br/>
owned to release her trauma and leave the abyss, she shouted. Thanks<br/>
to therapeutic techniques she was taught, she can sleep deeply, love<br/>
and open herself to others.</p>

<p>RISE4JUSTICE: &ldquo;Even Saving Just One Girl is Like Saving Humanity&rdquo;</p>

<p>On 13 May, Christine Schuler Deschryver and Eve Ensler sat down for a<br/>
special RISE4JUSTICE conversation at ABC Carpet &amp; Home in NYC.</p>

<p>The evening offered activists in the NYC area, and many more watching<br/>
online throughout the world, the opportunity to hear about the<br/>
situation facing women and girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo<br/>
(DRC) and what the City of Joy and V-World Farm are doing to end the<br/>
violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What keeps me going is seeing all of these girls changing and seeing<br/>
this community we created where love lives&rdquo; - Christine Schuler<br/>
Deschryver</p>
