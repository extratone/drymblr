<p>BREAKING NEWS:  Why I am stepping down. (It&rsquo;s not what you think.)<br/>
&amp;</p>

<p>Dear Feminist for Life,</p>

<p>Like you, I have long understood the critical need for a national    pro-woman, <br/>
pro-life advocacy and education organization which can empower    women to make <br/>
choices that realize their goals and a bright future for their    children.</p>

<p>I was delighted to learn that without known exception the first    feminists were<br/>
pro-life, and that Feminists for Life members and supporters    work to fulfill <br/>
Susan B. Anthony&rsquo;s unrealized dream to address the root causes    that drive women<br/>
to abortion.</p>

<p>I am proud of our message and materials, consistently amazed at    the results of<br/>
our advocacy and educational programs&ndash;and I can see the    tangible impacts of <br/>
our long-term strategies and initiatives.</p>

<p>I have    seen how FFL&rsquo;s message and solutions transform minds, campuses, political<br/>
   parties, governments, and cultures.</p>

<p>And I am grateful to the other FFL Board members, our staff,    volunteers, interns,<br/>
and you&ndash;our members and donors&ndash;who make our success    possible, and who stand<br/>
 with us to see our vital message amplified into coming    generations.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am gratified to have led this organization&rsquo;s Board of    Directors. At<br/>
 least I was until    recently. There is one area where    I know we have not measured<br/>
up&ndash;and I&rsquo;m determined to change that.</p>

<p>And that is why I have decided to step down as Chair of FFL&rsquo;s    Board of Directors.</p>

<p>I am not leaving Feminists for Life; I intend to continue as    an active member<br/>
 and Board member, perhaps even more active than before.    But I need to focus-with<br/>
your help on the one area where we    need to grow: Our capacity to    fund our <br/>
advocacy and education programs.  In effect, what I&rsquo;m really doing is    &ldquo;stepping<br/>
UP&rdquo; to the task of helping to ensure a strong financial basis that    will enable<br/>
FFL to have an even greater impact.</p>

<p>I have offered to go wherever I can help to find significant    donors to enlarge<br/>
and step up the pace of our efforts on behalf of women and    children.</p>

<p>My successor as FFL Board Chair, Cindy Pacewic Brown, is a proven    leader and <br/>
a strategic thinker, and she will depend on us to help FFL move    forward. We have<br/>
a dedicated    Board, a too-small but talented staff, and terrific summer interns<br/>
who    worked with staff on the Annual Capitol Hill Intern Briefing and many more<br/>
exciting projects.</p>

<p>FFL President Serrin Foster, the staff and editorial    team has also been busy <br/>
working on the latest insightful issue of The American Feminist®.</p>

<p>As you know, our mission is to systematically address the root    causes that drive<br/>
women to abortion, primarily a lack of resources and    support.</p>

<p>Our new issue explores the opposite of support: Shame.</p>

<p>We explore the impact of shame as it relates to those who are pregnant or parenting<br/>
and poor, birthmothers, parents of large families,    students, rape survivors and<br/>
those who were driven to abortion.</p>

<p>Our College Outreach Program coordinator is busy with the staff    preparing for<br/>
 the school year ahead.</p>

<p>Our forward-leaning focus and the need for preparation affords us    only a brief<br/>
moment to celebrate the year just completed. Our speakers and staff traveled from<br/>
   coast to coast bringing our powerful message of hope, declaring that &ldquo;Women  <br/>
  Deserve Better® than Abortion&rdquo; and that the post-Roe generation can &ldquo;Refuse to<br/>
    Choose®&rdquo; between women and children, between sacrificing their education and<br/>
    career plans and sacrificing their children.</p>

<p>Thanks to you and people like you, we had a terrific year, and plan to make    this<br/>
summer and the 2014-2015 school year even better.</p>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t happen without you and    others who understand this requires planning,<br/>
strategy, marketing, printing,    shipping, and guiding pro-life student leaders.<br/>

<p>We look forward to reaching more Federal and state leaders with our    &ldquo;Pro-Woman<br/>
Answers to Pro-Choice Questions&trade;&rdquo; and other    materials.</p>

<p>Because of Feminists for Life and your past support, every day we    move closer<br/>
 to creating a society that embraces life and addresses the root    causes that <br/>
drive women to abortion.</p>

<p>Over the years I have personally witnessed the impact on students    who hear FFL&rsquo;s<br/>
message and solutions during lectures and Pregnancy Resource    Forums at my alma<br/>
mater (UC    Berkeley), Serrin&rsquo;s debate at Harvard University&rsquo;s Kennedy School of<br/>
   Government, and at our annual Capitol Hill Intern Briefing, where our panel of<br/>
   speakers address student summer interns from across the    country. FFL speakers<br/>
inspire our courageous pro-life students.</p>

<p>One    of our dedicated summer interns put it this way: &ldquo;Feminists for Life articulates<br/>
what I    thought and never knew how to say. It prepares me to talk to my peers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even more remarkably, FFL speakers draw crowds of pro-choice students! And isn&rsquo;t<br/>
 that who we really need to    reach?</p>

<p>Remember, these students    have never known a day without abortion. They may show<br/>
up suspicious or even    combative-like the line of protesters that greeted Serrin<br/>
in a hallway outside    the lecture forum at Berkeley. (She shook the hand of every<br/>
one of    those protesters as she went through the crowd.)</p>

<p>But you can see the    wheels turning when they hear FFL&rsquo;s uniquely pro-woman approach,<br/>
and    they inevitably agree with FFL on many points, even to the point of offering<br/>
   to work on addressing the unmet needs of women. They actually begin to reconsider<br/>
   abortion!</p>

<p>Remember the first time you heard the name &ldquo;Feminists for Life&rdquo;    and understood<br/>
our unique capacity to reach those at highest risk? Help us pass it on.</p>

<p>As a father, as a feminist, as an alum, I know that with your help, FFL is    uniquely<br/>
positioned to succeed.

abortion.</p>
