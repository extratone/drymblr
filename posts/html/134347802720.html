                    <p>Hi there Dry!</p>

<p><br/>
Your semester is coming to a close and you&rsquo;re probably up to your eyeballs in final essays, presentations, and exams. (Not to mention all those Thanksgiving leftovers.) We want to take a moment thank you for all the amazing work you&rsquo;ve done this semester and say: Y'ALL ROCK! Before you start binging on all the TV shows you&rsquo;ve missed over the last four months, we want to remind you of one last assignment: *Feminist Campus&rsquo; **End of Semester Survey [ <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feministsurvey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feministsurvey</a> ]** [ <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feministsurvey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feministsurvey</a> ]*. </p>
