<p>The World RISES for Justice. Over 100 Countries Signed on!</p>

<p>The One Billion Rising for Justice campaign is rapidly building upon<br/>
the energy and momentum that was created in early 2013 when one<br/>
billion activists in 207 countries came together to strike, dance, and<br/>
rise to end violence against women and girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 2013, one billion rose around the world to end violence<br/>
against women and girls in the biggest mass action in the history of<br/>
the world. This year we are escalating and connecting the dots. We are<br/>
rising for gender, economic, racial, environmental Justice. We are<br/>
rising and dancing with our bodies, to end the violations towards our<br/>
bodies and the body of the earth,&rdquo; stated V-Day Founder and<br/>
award winning playwright Eve Ensler.</p>

<p>Expanded Website Featuring Videos from Haiti, the Philippines, South<br/>
Africa, Syria, &amp; More</p>

<p>The expanded One Billion Rising website will feature activist videos,<br/>
daily news updates and photos, information on joining the campaign and<br/>
much more. Individuals and organizations can get involved with One<br/>
Billion Rising online by adding to the thousands already signed up.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;This is What Justice Looks Like&rdquo; project launches<br/>
today as a forum in which activists can share their definitions of<br/>
justice in the form of text, image, and video in an online collage on<br/>
the campaign website. The series debuts with videos from activists in<br/>
Haiti, the Philippines, South Africa, Syria, and more. Contributors<br/>
are encouraged to visualize what justice looks like harnessing their<br/>
power and imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine, one billion women releasing their stories, dancing and<br/>
speaking out at the places where they need justice, where they need an<br/>
end to violence against women and girls. Join us - Rise,<br/>
Release, Dance!&rdquo; said One Billion Rising Director Monique<br/>
Wilson.</p>

<p>The One Billion Rising for Justice Events Map will illustrate the<br/>
worldwide scope of the movement through a searchable map that includes<br/>
events planned for the 2014 Rising. Organizers are encouraged to add<br/>
their events to the map to spread the word about their events and be<br/>
counted among the Rising. This year, they will have the additional<br/>
ability to add photos, video links and more information than last<br/>
year, utilizing the map for maximum public awareness and reach.</p>
