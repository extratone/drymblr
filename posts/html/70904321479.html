&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;&amp;;</p>

<p>On behalf of the Board and staff, we sincerely thank everyone for their efforts <br/>
and financial support in 2013, most especially our donors, members, interns, and<br/>
 volunteers. While we are strategic and frugal in our efforts, we also work hard<br/>
 to ensure that every dollar and every minute is impactful.</p>

<p>It is my pleasure to report on Feminists for Life&rsquo;s activities as we draw near to<br/>
the conclusion of a year marking the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. It is not <br/>
something we celebrate, but we do celebrate the work of those who contributed in<br/>
 many ways possible.</p>

<p>FFL recognizes that abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women.<br/>
Our mission is to systematically eliminate the root causes that drive women to abortion&ndash;primarily<br/>
a lack of resources and support. Women deserve better than abortion.</p>

<p>Our strategic efforts center on education and advocacy, especially for those at <br/>
highest risk of abortion:</p>

<p>The poor including the working poor, college students, young working women, victims<br/>
of violence, mothers and fathers, birthparents, and women who have had abortions.</p>

<p>Because women deserve better,</p>

<p>Serrin M. Foster</p>

<p>President</p>

<p>Significant accomplishments and milestones include:</p>

<p>NEW WEBSITE&ndash;the Gateway to FFL: <a href="http://www.FeministsForLife.org">www.FeministsForLife.org</a> [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Ea-aLDAE8RRYSHfbf0OD3JgE28vCuDzR5yOGc8_Ac7lE_XLWV0VfY3lw5ob7rAt8j3T2rYas6WNMJQam5wNfCMso73yCV0TkstEVhhQlP8GQYj2G1U0qkTagG5LyHPW4nBbU8CmW-rTyb2HsD_guZ6qEeongHexONZ7poTpXXhKNxAmjdJWOWw==&amp;c=mTJMF9oM27ENq1Yqzt653WgJc7JO4scHGaVFE8I3Bq7vpQvRQm3jOg==&amp;ch=Ja9NHnJ36Tp_aNqHbX7d0jcpkKRiV-CyKd28awe0Vg-rfoeIvA4_zg==]</p>

<p>Among our biggest accomplishments was a dream of ours made possible by a core group<br/>
of visionary and dedicated donors&ndash;completely redesigning our website! The gateway<br/>
to FFL welcomes visitors and educates activists by providing:</p>

<p><br/>
* pro-life feminist history&ndash;originally researched by FFL,<br/>
* pro-woman answers to questions from people who have never known a day without <br/>
abortion, many of whom have experienced this form of violence against women and <br/>
children,<br/>
* our College Outreach Program,<br/>
* &ldquo;Women Deserve Better® than Abortion&rdquo; campaign and other ads,<br/>
* tools for schools and other advocates, and<br/>
* connecting those in need and service providers to free, frugal resources and creative<br/>
solutions.</p>

<p>There are many new website features and we hope you enjoy sharing them with your<br/>
 family and friends.</p>

<p>FFL&rsquo;s Leadership Role for the Needs of Victims of Violence:</p>

<p>FFL&rsquo;s decades long record of advocacy and education made FFL the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; group for<br/>
answers when controversy arose because of misstatements by politicians and university<br/>
officials regarding the question, &ldquo;What about abortion in the case of rape?&rdquo;</p>

<p><br/>
* The American Feminist entitled &ldquo;Hard Cases, Exceptional Choices&rdquo; edited by Jewels<br/>
Green was published sharing our pro-woman answers and personal stories by women <br/>
like FFL Speaker Joyce McCauley-Benner who chose victory over violence.<br/>
* Writer Mary Meehan recognized FFL&rsquo;s decades-long advocacy on behalf of rape survivors<br/>
since supporting the original Violence Against Women Act. Read her thoughtful article<br/>
in Human Life Review. &ldquo;Rape and Abortion: A Double Injustice [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Ea-aLDAE8RRYSHfbf0OD3JgE28vCuDzR5yOGc8_Ac7lE_XLWV0VfY3WM4RLPTTIJZJYlycauxzh7vUEB70TdedlmYhxEhLp8kFmr4Xhqgbsxm55Hf_NM589vqbNbG0m6m5PdmJXnrAXveJTYpVoS97FgvvuUTcvwQEmdv0tNrSsRo9rofyuSvCZVzFZ4ABc6&amp;c=mTJMF9oM27ENq1Yqzt653WgJc7JO4scHGaVFE8I3Bq7vpQvRQm3jOg==&amp;ch=Ja9NHnJ36Tp_aNqHbX7d0jcpkKRiV-CyKd28awe0Vg-rfoeIvA4_zg==].&rdquo;<br/>
* Kathryn Jean Lopez included our pro-woman answers in National Review. See more<br/>
 information below.<br/>
* Our Vice President Sally Winn worked directly with a legislative coalition to <br/>
advocate for rape survivors in Montana.</p>

<p>Capitol Hill Briefing</p>

<p>During the Capitol Hill briefing for interns, President Serrin Foster moderated <br/>
a panel featuring our Vice President Sally Winn, editor Jewels Green and speaker<br/>
 Joyce McCauley-Benner who each shared their personal stories about their unplanned<br/>
pregnancies to college students from across the country interning in Washington <br/>
during our Annual Capitol Hill briefing.</p>

<p>Sally and Jewels also shared their personal stories of conversion in the most recent<br/>
issue of The American Feminist &ldquo;Metamorphosis&rdquo; along with other women who reconsidered<br/>
the many promises made by abortion advocates to women.</p>

<p>Our NEW issue ofThe American Feminist is an updated &ldquo;Pro-Woman Answers to Pro-Choice<br/>
QuestionsTM&rdquo; and includes:</p>

<p><br/>
* Talking points include &ldquo;Women Deserve Better® than Abortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Refuse to Choose®&rdquo;<br/>
slogans.<br/>
* Special article focuses on &ldquo;Birthmothers Deserve Better.&rdquo;<br/>
* With your help we plan to distribute this tool to thousands of student activists<br/>
who are leaders, today on campus and will be leaders in every field in the future.<br/>
* We will also distribute them to every student activist at three huge student conferences<br/>
coinciding with Roe events in Washington, DC and California, legislators on Capitol<br/>
Hill, and for the first time legislators at the STATE level!!</p>

<p>FFL&rsquo;s College Outreach Program is our flagship program. Our powerful speakers traversed<br/>
the country&ndash;and beyond!</p>

<p>Last school year Serrin was able to address students in:</p>

<p><br/>
* Pennsylvania (University of Pittsburgh),<br/>
* Massachusetts (Ave Maria College, MIT, Boston University lecture and returned <br/>
to moderated their 1st FFL Pregnancy Resource Forum and Boston College for their<br/>
 3rd Pregnancy Resource Forum),<br/>
* South Carolina (Wofford College and ConverseCollege),<br/>
* Illinois(University of DePaulUniversity in Chicago), and<br/>
* Washington, DC (Georgetown lecture and Pregnancy Resource Forum).</p>

<p>Vice President Sally Winn spoke to packed audiences at student conferences in Washington,<br/>
DC and Maryland and traveled across the country to speak in:</p>

<p><br/>
* California (University of San Diego and Stanford University),<br/>
* Indiana (University of Notre Dame),<br/>
* Missouri (Saint Louis University),<br/>
* Montana (Carroll College and Montana State University),<br/>
* Illinois (Bradley University),<br/>
* Nebraska (Creighton University),<br/>
* Michigan (University of Michigan), and<br/>
* Connecticut (for a first ever pro-life conference at Yale).</p>

<p>Most exciting, Vice President Sally Winn (at podium, left) participated in a debate<br/>
about pro-life feminism held by the oldest student organization in the world, The<br/>
Philosophical Society of Trinity College - Dublin. She also met with numerous leaders<br/>
in the pro-woman, pro-life movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Serrin (front row, middle) met with 18 legislators from the <br/>
Republic of Ireland, including two senators who traveled to Washington, DC.</p>

<p>Joyce McCauley-Benner shared her story at Saint John&rsquo;s and St. Benedict&rsquo;s in Minnesota<br/>
and the College of Wooster in Ohio.</p>

<p>FFL&rsquo;s Pregnancy Resource Forum is the crown jewel of our College Outreach Program.</p>

<p>In addition to returning to Boston College for their 3rd event and the following<br/>
 semester to Boston University for their first event, Serrin was especially pleased<br/>
to moderate the 18th annual Pregnancy Resource Forum at Georgetown University.</p>

<p>This year Georgetown decided to make a child care scholarship their next goal. They<br/>
also host an annual diaper drive for the Northwest Center&ndash;and plan to have an exhibit<br/>
to help change the culture on campus.</p>

<p>Thanks to you, every year we have donated copies of &ldquo;Raising Kids on A Shoestring&rdquo;<br/>
to pregnant and parenting students, their advisors, and counselors at every Forum<br/>
and lecture.</p>

<p>For the first time, a child could enter college next year who benefited from our<br/>
 program&ndash;and the example that has inspired efforts at other schools and by other<br/>
organizations across the country and around the world.</p>

<p>VICTORY FOR WOMEN!</p>

<p>After years of FFL advocating and educating the colleges, universities, and highest<br/>
levels of government about the ongoing discrimination against pregnant women and<br/>
 documenting the lack of resources and support for pregnant women, parents, and <br/>
birthparents through &ldquo;Perception is Reality,&rdquo; the US Department of Education has<br/>
 issued information to university administrators across the country which tells <br/>
them what they must and must not do to comply with US law.</p>

<p>FFL is asking our activists to write your alma mater to help inform them of the <br/>
Department of Education document and let them know about FFL&rsquo;s help to establish<br/>
 policies, take an inventory of resources and support on campus and in the community,<br/>
create a plan to move forward with solutions, and communicate them through a variety<br/>
of means.</p>

<p>Third Party Organizations</p>

<p><br/>
* At the national level, Sally Winn and Serrin were invited to address the second<br/>
annual conference on social justice hosted by Focus on the Family.<br/>
* Last year Sally was the featured speaker at a Roe v. Wade rally in Montana.<br/>
* Behind the scenes, we continue to advise many state level groups about pro-woman<br/>
initiatives as it relates to legislation.</p>

<p>Speaking Engagements During the 41st Anniversary of Roe v. Wade</p>

<p>Serrin will address those attending the RALLY FOR LIFE at the Vermont House State<br/>
Chamber this January and will rush back to DC to address 1,500 students from the<br/>
 St. Louis Archdiocese on the Martin Luther King Holiday. Jewels will speak the <br/>
next night to the same group. Meanwhile, Sally will address the leadership at the<br/>
Students for Life of America&rsquo;s (SFLA) National Conference in Maryland. Thousands<br/>
 are expected to attend. FFL Speaker, labor and delivery nurse, and former College<br/>
Outreach Program Coordinator Chaunie Brusie will be signing her new book, &ldquo;Two Tiny<br/>
Blue Lines&rdquo; at the FFL booth. Then Sally is off to San Francisco for the first-ever<br/>
SFLA West-Coast Conference!</p>

<p>Every registrant will receive our updated &ldquo;Pro-Woman Answers to Pro-Choice Questions&rdquo;<br/>
at the SFLA conferences and the Cardinal O'Connor Conference at Georgetown University.</p>

<p>FFL will once again be at the March for Life and also at the Walk for Life West <br/>
Coast. If you are in San Francisco please meet Pat O'Kane, the chair of our board,<br/>
and other FFL volunteers. Be sure to pick up one of our NEW &ldquo;Women Deserve Better<br/>
than Abortion&rdquo; placards. The other side declares, &ldquo;All People Are Equal. All Choices<br/>
Are NotTM&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other Upcoming Events</p>

<p>Serrin will present her landmark speech, &ldquo;The Feminist Case Against Abortion&rdquo; at<br/>
 Providence College in Rhode Island in February, the Houston Coalition for Life <br/>
in March, and the Washington Catholic Conference in Tacoma next October. Sally will<br/>
return to the College of Wooster in February to host their first-ever Pregnancy <br/>
Resource Forum. Many more events are in the works. Be sure to contact coordinator@ffloncampus.org<br/>
[mailto:coordinator@ffloncampus.org] to book a speaker early for your next pro-woman,<br/>
pro-life rally, banquet, conference, or campus event.</p>

<p>We have an urgent need to get speakers to a number of schools whose pro-life groups<br/>
have no club funding.  The pro-life students hope that we have the money to cover<br/>
the flights, hotels, and other expenses&ndash;including our materials.</p>

<p>It simply just isn&rsquo;t the case. Even when a speaker travels locally we have to pay<br/>
for materials, and our visually rich and informative brochures and magazines are<br/>
 great but also costly.</p>

<p>We are doing our best to leverage other events so that we can piggyback lectures<br/>
 and pregnancy resource forums when we travel, but costs remain and expectations<br/>
 are high.  Combined expenses for most out-of-town events start at over $1500.</p>

<p>Media Coverage<br/>
Feminists for Life speaks to people through various news sources on the both sides<br/>
of the political aisle as well as those of various religions and none. Recent media<br/>
coverage includes:</p>
