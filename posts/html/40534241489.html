Dear Dry, </p>

<p>NYFLC 2012 [ <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/">http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/</a> ]The next couple weeks are going to be filled with renewed energy for the semester ahead, and we are so excited to hear more about what you have planned for your campus! </p>

<p>Hopefully at the end of last semester you saw that we announced the opening of registration for the 9th Annual National Young Feminist Leadership Conference [ <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/">http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/</a> ]. Early bird registration is now open â€“ get discounts for signing up early until February 1! Looking for discounts for groups of 4 or more? Contact nyflc@feminist.org [ mailto:nyflc@feminist.org ]. </p>

<p>Over 500 feminist students from across the country will be coming together for an amazing weekend of activist training and learning. Among other topics, we will focus on women&rsquo;s reproductive health rights (both domestic and abroad) and how to get involved in advocacy in your state capitols. </p>

<p>The Campus Team is very excited to have a special conference hotel rate at the Double Tree by Hilton in Crystal City, and we&rsquo;re sure it will provide a great atmosphere for connecting with your fellow feminists. Be sure to make your reservations by March 8 in order to take advantage of the discounted rates! </p>

<p>We also want to remind you that the Feminist Campus Team [ <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/fmla/organizers/default.asp">http://www.feministcampus.org/fmla/organizers/default.asp</a> ] is here to help you plan your delegation&rsquo;s trip every step of the way. </p>

<p>We will be recognizing the largest delegations, as well as the farthest travelled, with some amazing prizes and feminist goodies such as Ms. Magazine memberships, &ldquo;This is What a Feminist Looks Like&rdquo; gear, and some other surprises from our Feminist Store. </p>

<p>Spring term is a great time for some feminist action, so head on over to our Campaigns &amp; Action page to check out our tool kits and find some great ideas on how to create change in your campus community. As always, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to your National Campus Organizer; we are always looking forward to hearing from you! </p>

<p>For equality, </p>

<p>*FMF Campus Team* <br/>
