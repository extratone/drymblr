                    <p>Dear Dry,</p>

<p>Registration Button</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited that we are bringing together a great combination of feminist activists, experts and leaders at our Women, Money, and Power Summit on November 5 at the National Press Club in Washington, DC!</p>

<p>Trust me, Dry, you won&rsquo;t want to miss it!</p>

<p><br/>
The Summit will kick off with a lively forum discussion on maximizing the women&rsquo;s vote and the role of gender in elections.</p>

<p>At the Summit Luncheon, we&rsquo;ll be honoring Congresswomen Louise Slaughter, Barbara Lee, and Donna Edwards. They are fearless champions for women&rsquo;s rights, social justice, and stopping violence against women.</p>

<p>After the Luncheon, our afternoon forum will provide attendees with key strategies for advancing the feminist agenda. Take a glance at the Women Money Power Summit agenda!</p>

<p>Join us to celebrate, activate, and recharge your batteries. We need to be as strong as possible to meet today&rsquo;s challenges and push steadily forward. We will win equal pay. We won&rsquo;t go back to the days of back alleys for vitally needed healthcare. We will win constitutional equality for women.</p>

<p>Dry, please register today for what we know will be an exciting and informative event! Space is filling up fast and we don&rsquo;t want you to miss out.</p>

<p>For Equality,</p>
