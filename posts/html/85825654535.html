<p>Finding a good gym in the city can be harder than finding an apartment&hellip;without a broker&rsquo;s fee&hellip;that has laundry in the building.</p>

<p>In other words, (almost) impossible.</p>

<p>And while landlords don&rsquo;t offer one-day trials, we are a club that will (because commitment is hard)!</p>

<p>Reebok Sports Club NY is hooking up VSL readers with a complimentary, one-day membership so you can test drive this sweat temple for free.</p>

<p>Reebok Sports Club NY offers up to 170 classes per week—from yoga to group resistance training to its one-of-a-kind (and fun!) Recess class.</p>

<p>Get in shape using space-age(ish) machinery, swimming laps in the 25-yard indoor pool, playing ball on two regulation-size basketball courts and punching out frustrations in the boxing studio.</p>

<p>If you like what you see and smell—seriously, we have MALIN+GOETZ in our locker rooms—you can extend your membership for free perks.</p>

<p>With a membership, you&rsquo;ll score a complimentary wellness package (valued at about $400)&hellip;not to mention a healthier lifestyle.</p>
