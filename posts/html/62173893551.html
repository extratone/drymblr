<p>Happy National Voter Registration Day! [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/blog/index.php/2013/09/24/im-a-registered-virginia-feminist-celebrating-national-voter-registration-day-by-taking-action/">http://feministcampus.org/blog/index.php/2013/09/24/im-a-registered-virginia-feminist-celebrating-national-voter-registration-day-by-taking-action/</a> ] </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s National Voter Registration Day [ <a href="http://www.nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">http://www.nationalvoterregistrationday.org/</a> ], and it couldn&rsquo;t possibly matter more. In the past year, we&rsquo;ve seen unprecendented attacks on women&rsquo;s health and equality; voting can be a key part of fighting back [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/vote/">http://feministcampus.org/vote/</a> ]. (In some states, it can also be an act of protest against restrictive student voting laws [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/blog/index.php/2013/08/28/roundtable-students-speak-out-against-voting-restrictions-targeting-young-people/">http://feministcampus.org/blog/index.php/2013/08/28/roundtable-students-speak-out-against-voting-restrictions-targeting-young-people/</a> ] that make it hard for us to be heard.) Kristy took to our blog today to write about Virginia&rsquo;s upcoming election, and why being a registered feminist matters [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/blog/index.php/2013/09/24/im-a-registered-virginia-feminist-celebrating-national-voter-registration-day-by-taking-action/">http://feministcampus.org/blog/index.php/2013/09/24/im-a-registered-virginia-feminist-celebrating-national-voter-registration-day-by-taking-action/</a> ].
