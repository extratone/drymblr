                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>The industry of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; food has been anything but speedy in granting a living wage to its employees. Workers are expected to survive on just $7.25/hour - but now, across the country, they&rsquo;re striking for a $15/hour paycheck. </p>

<p>Our new edition of Ms. [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] features today&rsquo;s Rosie the Riveter: the woman taking your fast-food order. Struggling to cover basic needs such as food and housing, she faces a reality that&rsquo;s difficult to stomach. </p>

<p>Trust me: When you read the facts about a $200 billion industry that primarily employs - and exploits - women, you&rsquo;ll never look at your hamburger the same way. </p>

<p>Get the full story in our newest edition of Ms.! [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] </p>
