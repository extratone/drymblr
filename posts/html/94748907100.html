<p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>Last week, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit blocked – for now – the closing of Mississippi&rsquo;s last remaining clinic, the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization. </p>

<p>*We need your help to provide new security measures for the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi*. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] Half of your gift will go directly to the clinic for improving security measures, and half will support our work keeping clinics like the Jackson clinic open and safe.</p>

<p>The day before the federal appeals court&rsquo;s decision, in another courtroom, our Clinic Defense Team was present when a Jackson city court judge found three Operation Rescue/Operation Save America protestors GUILTY of obstructing the sidewalk in front of and interfering with the clinic.</p>

<p>Our team worked for nearly a year to see these extremists brought to justice. But threats to the safety of the Jackson clinic staff and physicians remain. </p>

<p>Now that the courts have acted, we must redouble our efforts to ensure the safety of all patients and personnel. The clinic continues to be targeted by national and local anti-abortion extremists – some of whom promote the &ldquo;justifiable homicide&rdquo; of doctors. It is critical that we implement new safety measures for the clinic as quickly as possible. *Won&rsquo;t you give today to help us provide greater protections for JWHO staff and patients?* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] </p>

<p>Our Clinic Defense team, together with a powerful coalition of community leaders, clinic staff, and volunteer escorts, is working to keep this essential clinic open. But more must be done to make sure the last remaining clinic in Mississippi is fortified with state-of-the-art security measures – especially now. </p>

<p>*Please make a tax-deductible gift to help the Jackson clinic and FMF&rsquo;s work to protect clinics.

<p>P.S. Without clinics there is no choice. *Please help the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Center and FMF&rsquo;s work to save clinics today.* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] </p>
