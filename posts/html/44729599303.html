<p>Dear All&hellip; A Letter From Eve in Congo</p>

<p>Eve Ensler has been in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for<br/>
the last month. Here she shares with you all her experiences with the<br/>
women at City of Joy, life on the V-World farm, and how she ROSE with<br/>
women and girls of Congo on 14 February.</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>

<p>First let me begin with the deepest thank you to all of you who<br/>
believed in City of Joy and have stood by us with your confidence and<br/>
support. I have spent the month here and all I can say, is you would<br/>
be proud. Let me start by describing the current state of Bukavu. It<br/>
is nothing short of catastrophic. In one of the richest resourced<br/>
countries in the world, the poverty is inconceivable. In a place where<br/>
it rains almost every day, there is no water.<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=YMaYbL-64nvC6HDlTyXW9Q">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=YMaYbL-64nvC6HDlTyXW9Q</a></p>

<p>It is a country with the most fertile green fields, people are<br/>
starving. There is no electricity. Most of the month the children have<br/>
been sent home from school as the teachers are on strike. (they have<br/>
not been paid). Even the policemen are begging for food. The road is<br/>
better but most of the time we have not driven on it as there are so<br/>
many reasons for detours. This is the environment our director<br/>
Christine and her astounding staff face and transcend every day. Then<br/>
of course there is the issue of security. The month I have been here<br/>
there have been no incidents, but it feels arbitrary as there is no<br/>
real political basis for security and one feels anything can happen at<br/>
any time.<br/>

<p>I will not even begin to tackle here the many proposals that seem to<br/>
be circulating for peace in Congo. They either feel rhetorical or<br/>
implausible. I think it is safe to say that if Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi<br/>
were to get out of Congo, if there were real leadership and a<br/>
functioning government in Kinshasa, there would be change. But that is<br/>
not the nature of what I am writing about. We made a decision four<br/>
years ago to put our energy into the grassroots women of Congo, to<br/>
support their visions, their plans, their desires, their futures. To<br/>
believe in their strength. To find the support for them to heal from<br/>
gender violence of all forms, to be trained and educated in skills and<br/>
their rights, to become leaders in their communities so that they<br/>
could build a grassroots movement that eventually would be strong<br/>
enough to transform this country and turn pain to power.<br/>
