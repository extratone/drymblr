                                    <h1>Giving Birth to Abolition, Feminism, and FFL</h1>
                    <p>&amp;<br/>
&amp;<br/>
&amp;</p>

<p>We know Alice  Paul as the suffragist leader who achieved passage of the 19th Amendment<br/>
 and authored the original Equal Rights Amendment. But when Paul met  Feminists <br/>
for Life co-founder Pat Goltz, Paul told Pat that FFL was not  the first pro-life<br/>
feminist group. Alice Paul said she and other  first-wave feminists opposed abortion<br/>
too.</p>

<p>The same belief in human rights that inspired abolition became the undulating impulse<br/>
that gave birth to feminism.</p>

<p>The first feminists&ndash;who had no legal  right to vote, testify on their own behalf,<br/>
or sit on a jury&ndash;affirmed  the fundamental liberty of every woman, just as many<br/>
 had affirmed the  fundamental liberty of every enslaved person. Denied the right<br/>
to stop  marital rape, control their own finances, or (with the exception of  Oberlin<br/>
College) pursue higher education, the first feminists still  found strength to give<br/>
voice to the most vulnerable, including born  children in need of empowered parents<br/>
and unborn children peacefully  floating in their mothers&rsquo; wombs.</p>

<p>When I first started at Feminists for  Life, an opponent of FFL&rsquo;s emerging voice<br/>
 alleged we offered only one  pro-life quote from one lone suffragist that we kept<br/>
repeating over and  over again. Famous historians peddled the claim that there was<br/>
no  documentation of Susan B. Anthony&rsquo;s opposition to abortion.</p>

<p>But thanks to the late Mary Krane Derr, who was commissioned by the FFL Board of<br/>
 Directors to research The Revolution (published by Susan B. Anthony and co-edited<br/>
by Elizabeth Cady Stanton) and Woodhull and Claflin&rsquo;s Weekly (published by Victoria<br/>
Woodhull and Tennessee Claflin), we established  an undeniable consensus among early<br/>
feminists against the horror of  abortion. Other researchers like Suzanne Schnittman,<br/>
Lisa Bellecci-st. romain, and Ruth Moynihan dove deeper, bringing our rich pro-life<br/>
 feminist history forward into the light.</p>

<p>The early feminists had a spectrum of  opinions and pursuits within their movement,<br/>
just as we have within pro-life feminism today. Like second wave feminists of the<br/>
1970s, many of  whom strayed from feminism&rsquo;s original non-violent tenets, some of<br/>
the  first wave feminists&rsquo; words and actions can be disappointing-even  offensive.<br/>
Suzanne Schnittman warned me long ago that these were not  perfect people any more<br/>
than we are.</p>

<p>Without known exception, every  first-wave feminist who spoke out on abortion strongly<br/>
opposed it. Some  addressed the unmet needs of women driven to abortion; others <br/>
focused on  the children threatened by it; and all expressed intense and unwavering<br/>
 opposition to it.</p>

<p>Feminists for Life surges forward to  fulfill the urgent, unrealized dreams of first-wave<br/>
feminists Alice  Paul, Susan B. Anthony, and others&ndash;to systematically eliminate<br/>
 the root  causes that drive women to abortion.</p>

<p>While we seek solutions in homes, the workplace, schools, and communities&ndash;especially<br/>
for those at highest risk of abortion&ndash;we stay true to our core feminist beliefs<br/>
 of nonviolence, nondiscrimination, and justice for all.</p>

<p>Your support ensures that through our advocacy and education we can reach that once-far<br/>
shore [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001uxXlJHz_agt_KyTK-ZG1iu-G7f1240JNO8aj9_qEy2NwxX3hF1qi1zQPT-qvbrIwDrf7Hi2n3rOV1gVFPwDiqGjbRRblGHAaH-K0LRwWButD0EtSWXL7p-X88FBt0kXoLE_rEy53cB8d3AQm7mE4QPxRTAuebsV3-iri01ZcmfwoaDc2bfZMJyTAV8M3iYLGZ5JWnKFhrnQ=&amp;c=Ij8piOkwpRromd3428GvHs9zk-7aTLodOWuOO_kW7fO-De-dhX6Nog==&amp;ch=aJOcbZpjQPemp-uZzWGoIGcx_SfGVrxzn3iUxB_DPmLDhAK8MyoMyA==].<br/>
That day, when  no woman feels driven to abortion, is coming-propelled ever faster<br/>

<p>That day is coming.</p>
