<p>&ldquo;&hellip;When I read about [One Billion Rising for Justice], how people get<br/>
together of their own free will and dance, use their bodies, to<br/>
express their rage- outrage- around the injustice that women feel all<br/>
over the world, every day- I was inspired&hellip;We are all equally<br/>
deserving of respect and personal space. I will fight for that right<br/>
for all of us. And we come together to do so on our stage, with our<br/>
brothers and menfolk- where we express our freedom every night. And<br/>
that freedom inspires others to be free. We hope this video helps. And<br/>
we hope for that one day when all women and girls are able to have<br/>
respect, and personal space, and to be able to express themselves in<br/>
whatever way THEY feel is right for them&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>

<p>Being Here Now: a Statement for 14 February</p>

<p>Here we are, at the great rising. Here, where every minute a new<br/>
story, a new song, photo, poster, poem, justice video<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=Li1vRw2f6eCvx_wuY_kFig">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=Li1vRw2f6eCvx_wuY_kFig</a></p>

<p>is made and released from some part of the world. Here, where young<br/>
girls in the Philippines chant on the streets that &ldquo;if this is the new<br/>
world, I want to be part of it.&rdquo; Here, where a genius woman mentor of<br/>
formerly incarcerated women in South Central LA decides on the spot to<br/>
call a rising at the country jail, essentially a mental institution<br/>
where women inmates are horribly abused and left untreated. Here,<br/>
where two opposing teams of footballers in Peru enter the field in<br/>
solidarity wearing One Billion Rising T-shirts, and where construction<br/>
workers declare their sites free of sexual harassment</p>

<p>protesting the murder of women and men who venture into the park for<br/>
wood or water or to retrieve their own cattle. Here, where hundreds of<br/>
thousands of rickshaw drivers in India are sensitized about sexual<br/>
violence and now carry signs on their rickshaws that read &ldquo;My religion<br/>
is respecting women.&rdquo; Here, in the US where activists are literally<br/>
stopping traffic to end human trafficking in Miami</p>

<p>, Somalia, where women are risking their lives to rise and take back<br/>
the streets. Here, in the Caribbean where they rise to make all forms<br/>
of marital rape illegal. Here, in London where a coalition of women<br/>
demand an end to FGM and justice for asylum seekers, domestic workers,<br/>
and incarcerated women at Trafalgar Square</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=LL_eoNuBstZ3O-DvzHQu5Q">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=LL_eoNuBstZ3O-DvzHQu5Q</a></p>

<p>. Here, where police officers, rocks stars, tribal leaders, mayors,<br/>
governors, MP&rsquo;s Congresspeople, Presidents, Queens, the Head<br/>
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, religious leaders, and<br/>
Bollywood stars rise with thousands of frontline social justice<br/>
organizations.</p>

<p>What is clear is that One Billion Rising for Justice has gone beyond a<br/>
1-day action in 190 countries. It is a global determination to end the<br/>
multiple violences - racial, gender, economic and environmental - that<br/>
intersect with violence against women. Women and men know a new time<br/>
has come and it will be determined and directed by activists on the<br/>
ground in each community who know the justice they need and deserve<br/>
and what they need to do to get it.</p>

<p>This week in Hong Kong, thousands of women migrant workers rose</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=Ym1uAsdWHRidFEVB9dh_2Q">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=Ym1uAsdWHRidFEVB9dh_2Q</a></p>

<p>and danced in the rain to end the horrific sexual, physical, and<br/>
economic violations they suffer on the job. They moved with<br/>
irrepressible rage, joy, determination, and unity to end the<br/>
conditions and systems that destroy their bodies and humanity.</p>

<p>We are Here. Together. The new Here that we have made with our<br/>
dedication, our bodies, our best strategies, our incessant organizing,<br/>
our coalition building, our inclusiveness, our mad dancing.</p>

<p>Here, 14 February 2014, where we give our lives to ending all forms of<br/>
oppression and all of the violences towards women. Where we work in<br/>
our deepest selves to rise above our divisions and join in local,<br/>
national, and global solidarity. Here, in the new world owned by no<br/>
one and directed by everyone, where creativity flows and we no longer<br/>
doubt the power of dance to release the trauma that has closed the<br/>
gateways of our bodies and hearts. May we free and call up the fire<br/>
and love.</p>

<p>V-Love,</p>

<p>Eve Ensler and Monique Wilson</p>
