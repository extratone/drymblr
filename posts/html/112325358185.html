                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>March is right around the corner, and that means young feminists from across the country will soon be gathering in our nation&rsquo;s capital for a weekend of feminist activism at the 2015 National Young Feminist Leadership Conference! *Don&rsquo;t you wanna be there?* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ] </p>

<p>From March 21 to 23, feminist leaders from colleges across the country will meet up at NYFLC to cover topics from global women&rsquo;s rights to reproductive justice in panel discussions and go over the basics of campus organizing in our workshops. Our events will feature campus activists, feminist and political leaders, and other public figures. Attendees will have the chance to take action, get inspired, network with other activists, and even grab some feminist gear or explore the nation&rsquo;s capital! </p>
