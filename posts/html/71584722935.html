                    <p>Drywall fans, I need your help. In less than 2 hours, we have one of our actors for only a limited time, and we don&rsquo;t have any scenes written for his character.  He&rsquo;s playing a schizophrenic compsci major working for Monsanto. His role: hacking all cultural databases and eliminating any evidence of the Amish people&rsquo;s existence. Think of him as that one short nerdy guy in The Italian Job or that cliche geek in any freakin&rsquo; heist movie. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at work right now and unable to write so I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate somebody writing up a scene and sending it to me. </p>

<p>Thanks guys for the help / I&rsquo;m gonna be really peeved if there aren&rsquo;t any responses when I get off. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be mentioned in the credits, it&rsquo;s a big honor.</p>
