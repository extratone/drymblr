<p>One Billion Rising 2016 In Action</p>

<p>Every February through 8 March, thousands of Risings take place in<br/>
communities around the world - to show the world what one<br/>
billion looks like and shine a light on the rampant impunity and<br/>
injustice that survivors of various forms of violence face. Through<br/>
the collective efforts of activists in 200 countries, One Billion<br/>
Rising has mobilised, engaged, awakened and joined people worldwide to<br/>
end violence against women. In 2016, the theme of Revolution continues<br/>
with a call to focus on marginalised women and to bring national and<br/>
international focus to their issues; to bring in new artistic energy;<br/>
to amplify Revolution as a call for system change to end violence<br/>
against women and girls; to call on people to rise for others, and not<br/>
just for ourselves.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for live updates on our website and social media channels,<br/>
and RISE in your community and online!</p>

<p>The 2016 OBR tour continues as Eve and Monique RISE with local<br/>
organizers and grassroots activists in cities and regions across the<br/>
country.</p>

<p>In Tondo, they rose for Life &amp; Livelihood, demanding and end to<br/>
violence and poverty and against the new coal factory that is dumping<br/>
in the area, further endangering residents. In Tacloban City, they<br/>
rose for justice for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and for Climate<br/>
Justice. In Davao City, they are rose for Lumad rights, rose against<br/>
militarization, against mining &amp; environmental plunder, and<br/>
against political   oppression and killing. The Mindanao region of the<br/>
Philippines is rich in natural mineral resources, making it the target<br/>
of large scale mining international companies who are plundering and<br/>
pillaging these rich bountiful land of gold, copper, nickel and<br/>
chromite - displacing thousands of Lumads from their ancestral<br/>
domains, and harassing, oppressing and killing them under the<br/>
Philippine Governments Oplan Bayanihan operations. The OBR Davao event<br/>
had the participation of multi-sectoral grassroots communities -<br/>
workers, urban poor, peasants, teachers, students, women&rsquo;s groups,<br/>
community groups, families of migrants, LGBT groups, groups for the<br/>
rights of sex workers, and Lumad communities who are currently<br/>
displaced because of militarization and living in evacuation camps in<br/>
the city.</p>
