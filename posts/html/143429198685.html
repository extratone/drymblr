<p>RISE To End Rape Culture: An Open Letter to Mayor Duterte by Monique<br/>
Wilson</p>

<p>Lola Narcisa.jpg</p>

<p>In response to statements made by presidential candidate and Davao<br/>
City Mayor Rodrigo<br/>
Duterte joking about a murdered Australian rape victim, One Billion<br/>
Rising Director Monique Wilson penned an open letter to Duterte<br/>
imploring him to use his voice to end rape culture. READ &amp; SHARE<br/>
the letter:</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=Qow0gZcch2yBPwn7GCmW9w">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=Qow0gZcch2yBPwn7GCmW9w</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayor Duterte, rape is rape. I don&rsquo;t have to tell you what that<br/>
means. But you need to understand the full gravity of rape and rape<br/>
culture. And where your actions play a part in perpetuating that.</p>

<p>Rape culture is denying the weight and seriousness of the crime by<br/>
joking about it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you tell us later on what the<br/>
context of the story was.</p>

<p>All that matters is that you made light of it, and allowed your<br/>
followers at that rally to laugh along, diminishing the gravity of the<br/>
rape.</p>

<p>Words are important Mayor. You cannot throw them out playfully and<br/>
casually and not look at the consequences of what your words do.&rdquo; -<br/>
Monique Wilson</p>

<p>Eve Profiles Yezidi Activist Nadia Murad for TIME&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 100 Most<br/>
Influential People&rdquo; Feature</p>

<p>In 2014, Nadia Murad was<br/>
kidnapped from her Kocho in Northern Iraq after ISIL militants<br/>
ransacked her village and murdered hundreds of men and older women.<br/>
After months of enslavement, suffering countless atrocities, she<br/>
escaped and is speaking out to raise awareness of the girls who remain<br/>
in captivity. Eve was asked by TIME Magazine to profile her as one of<br/>
the 100 Most Influential People:</p>

<p>A Witness for War&rsquo;s Victims</p>

<p>Nadia1.jpg<br/>
Nadia Murad stands in a long, invisible history of fierce, indomitable<br/>
women who rise from the scorched earth of rape during war to break the<br/>
odious silence and demand justice and freedom for their sisters. At 19<br/>
she lost her home, her country, her culture, her mother to murder;<br/>
witnessed male members of her family murdered in mass killings; and<br/>
was kidnapped, sold and endlessly raped by members of ISIS. She now<br/>
travels the world speaking out on the genocide being inflicted on her<br/>
Yezidi people and demanding release for the more than 3,000 women<br/>
still held in bondage.</p>

<p>As Europe closes its borders to terrorized refugees in Greece and the<br/>
U.S. turns its back on the suffering, Nadia is a beacon of light and<br/>
truth-a reminder that it was the American-led war in Iraq that<br/>
laid the path for ISIS, that U.S. arms left behind on the battlefield<br/>
fell into the hands of ISIS and that the U.S. waited too long to<br/>
intervene in the mass killing and enslavement of the Yezidi people. At<br/>
23, Nadia Murad is risking everything to awaken us. I hope we are<br/>
listening, because we too are responsible. - Ensler is a playwright<br/>
and the founder of V-Day, a movement to end violence against women and<br/>
girls</p>
