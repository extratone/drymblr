                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We know you&rsquo;ve been waiting, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to announce that  [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2015-nyflc/">http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2015-nyflc/</a> ]*Early Bird Registration is now open for the 11th Annual National Young Feminist Leadership Conference* [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2015-nyflc/">http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2015-nyflc/</a> ], taking place from March 21-23, 2015 at the Doubletree Crystal City – just one Metro stop outside Washington, D.C.! You won&rsquo;t want to miss out on this year&rsquo;s NYFLC: we&rsquo;ll be covering topics ranging from global women&rsquo;s rights to reproductive justice to campus organizing tips, and our events will feature campus activists, feminist and political leaders, and other public figures. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to take action, get inspired, network with other activists, and even grab some feminist gear or explore the nation&rsquo;s capital. </p>

<p>Our Early Bird rates are $25 for individuals and $20 per person for groups of five or more people. After Early Bird Registration closes, those rates will go up - so don&rsquo;t hesitate!
