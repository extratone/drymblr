<p>* Projectr.com/516ca68465217dc6e1b9a3a61t403.26pv/VA0eAEmOhegfMsZSC6d60&gt; preserves the data of one moment on Twitter and presents it categorized and ordered in four different physical books. I love technology, but seeing such a huge quantity of digital content reimagined in a physical context is a step back into &ldquo;real life&rdquo; that I find so interesting. [1 of 3]</p>

design 8 Sep 2014</p>

<p>* It was Edward Hopper&rsquo;s Nighthawks <http:> painting that inspired me to design a one person restaurant. In our hyper-connected society we&rsquo;re no longer used to being alone in public, at least not without our phones in our hands. I believe the need for disconnection is growing.

<p>* I&rsquo;m traveling to London next week and am excited to try out Behomm <http:>, a home-exchange site exclusively for creative design and visual art professionals. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
