<p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>Operation Rescue/Operation Save America has just announced plans for yet another siege of Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization (JWHO), the last remaining clinic in Mississippi. And Mississippi state lawmakers are continuing their attack on JWHO by asking for yet another hearing before the full Court of Appeals in a renewed effort to enforce restrictions that would close the JWHO clinic. </p>

<p>These ongoing outrageous attacks by lawmakers are emboldening extremists to go after the courageous doctors, staff and volunteers at JWHO – *won&rsquo;t you help us keep them safe?  [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ]* </p>

<p>*We need your help paying for new security measures for the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] Half of your gift will go directly to the clinic for improving security measures, and half will support our work keeping clinics like JWHO open and safe. </p>

<p>Our Clinic Defense team, together with a powerful coalition of community leaders, clinic staff, and volunteer escorts has been on the ground working to keep this essential clinic open. But more must be done to make sure the last clinic in Mississippi stays open and stays safe while anti-abortion extremists continue to target and terrorize the brave providers of JWHO. </p>

<p>If the JWHO clinic closes, Mississippi women seeking safe legal abortions will have no choice but to travel hundreds of miles to clinics in Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana. </p>

<p>*Won&rsquo;t you give today to help us provide greater protections for JWHO staff and patients?* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] We need your help to pay for critically important new structural security measures and video surveillance systems for JWHO right now. </p>

<p>*Please make a tax-deductible gift to support the National Clinic Access Project today.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ] </p>

<p>P.S. Without these courageous clinics like JWHO, there is no choice. *Please give today [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP14email</a> ]* – we don&rsquo;t have a moment to lose in our work to keep clinics open and health care workers safe! </p>
