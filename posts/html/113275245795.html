                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Today is the National Day of Appreciation for Abortion Providers. This year, we want to put the spotlight on the courageous doctors and staff of three clinics we know are working hard, despite continual threats against them, to provide crucial reproductive health services to women who need it most. *Join us in sending them our thanks!* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17364">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17364</a> ] </p>

<p>Remember - violence and threats against abortion clinics are not things of the past. A recent Feminist Majority Foundation report shows 1 in 5 abortion clinics are still the target of severe violence, and that incidents of harassment and stalking have actually increased since 2010.</p>

<p>These clinics are embattled, but their doctors, administrators, and healthcare workers brave it all to make sure women have the access to the vitally needed health services they deserve. *Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization* in Jackson, Mississippi; *South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center, LLC* in Wichita, Kansas; and *Reproductive Health Services* in Germantown, Maryland, are three examples of clinics that do what&rsquo;s right through adversity. </p>

<p>Make sure these clinics know they are appreciated! *Sign the card now and we will pass your name and support along to thank them for their courageous services.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17364">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17364</a> ] </p>

<p>For Women&rsquo;s Health and Lives, </p>
