			Stop by, we’d love to see you at any Yankee Candle Retail Store. </p>

<p>			Our discounts are here to help you get even more fragrances and accents into your home—try something new today!</p>

<p>			All of our discounts are applied to qualifying items on a prorated basis, which is shown on your receipt. That means if you return it for a refund you’ll receive the discounted (prorated) amount you actually paid, rather than the full price of the item before it was discounted. Some restrictions do apply and, as always, our discounts cannot be combined with any other coupons or offers. Discounts are valid in our US stores only, and prices may vary in Canadian stores. Price adjustments cannot be made on previous purchases. If you need an explanation, just ask any sales associate in our stores for help with these details. Or, if a store isn’t convenient, contact us directly through the several options listed below. We really do want to make this easy so you can enjoy as many candles, fragrances and accents as you like.</p>
