Yes, Ellie! You can count on me! [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9622">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9622</a> ]Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on whether state and local governments can create safety buffer zones around reproductive health clinics to protect patients, doctors and healthcare workers from harassment, intimidation and violence. </p>

<p>Buffer zones currently protect more than 35 percent of clinics in the nation. Three states and dozens of municipalities protect their clinics with buffer zones. It&rsquo;s an outrage that such critical protection may be taken away from besieged clinics. And if the Massachusetts buffer zone law is struck down, it will surely embolden violent, anti-abortion extremists. </p>

<p>Dry, this is a pivotal moment for clinics across the nation. We can&rsquo;t just sit back and wait for the Court&rsquo;s decision. We must act today.

<p>Many clinics are still not protected by buffer zones and regularly experience harassment, threats and intimidation. For over 20 years, FMF has provided security equipment and assessments, community support and legal services to besieged clinics. </p>

<p>We brought the first lawsuit in the nation on buffer zones to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994. That case, Madsen v. Women&rsquo;s Health Center, established the constitutionality of an injunction creating a clinic safety buffer zone for a Florida clinic. Today, we&rsquo;re fighting to ensure the Court upholds statewide buffer zones</p>
