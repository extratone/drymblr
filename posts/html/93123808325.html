<p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m proud to report the New Orleans clinics, doctors, staff, and patients, with the help of our Clinic Defense team, withstood a week-long siege by Operation Rescue/Save America (OR/OSA). With the support of many of you, our team was key in helping local officials, community leaders, and volunteer escorts ensure the safety of the clinics and their patients. </p>

<p>Now, the Feminist Majority Foundation Clinic Defense team is headed to Jackson, Mississippi. So are the extremists! </p>

<p>*We need your help to defend the only clinic in all of Mississippi â€“ the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization. * [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>

<p>Anti-abortion extremist Chet Gallagher will stand trial this week for his arrest at the Jackson clinic last year. *With your support, we will be on site to help the clinic stay open despite the hard core of extremists traveling to Jackson for the trial.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>

<p>We are most concerned about the possible presence of extremists who support &ldquo;justifiable homicide&rdquo; against doctors and clinic workers. We identified some of them taking part in the OR/OSA siege in New Orleans. Jackson is also home to a leading proponent of &ldquo;justifiable homicide.&rdquo; </p>

<p>We know our vigilance helps to prevent violence against doctors and clinics. Especially in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision striking down a Massachusetts clinic buffer zone law, our work to defend abortion clinics has become even more important. That&rsquo;s why we are asking for your support. </p>

<p>*Please make a tax-deductible contribution today to support our work to defend clinics.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>

<p>P.S. Without clinics there is no choice. *Please give today as our team travels to Jackson.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] </p>
