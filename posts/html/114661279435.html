                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>*For a limited time, you can get your name - and the name of a woman who inspires you - in an issue of &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo;!* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12256">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12256</a> ] </p>

<p></p>

<p>This Women&rsquo;s History Month we want to know who YOUR Wonder Woman is. Since its very first issue, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; magazine has been inspired by Wonder Woman - a fierce truthteller, just like &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Is your Wonder Woman your mother, a friend, your professor, a local feminist activist? Now is your chance to honor her. *Join the dedicated group of readers we call our &ldquo;Ms. &quot;partners, and we will list your name in a special section of our spring issue. You can also list the name of your Wonder Woman.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12256">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12256</a> ] </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s even better is that an anonymous donor has pledged $10,000 if we can get 430 new Ms. partners and 10 lifetime partners before the end of the drive! </p>

<p>How can you help us reach this goal? To become a &quot;Ms. &quot;Partner and to get your name and your Wonder Woman&rsquo;s name listed, make a one-time, tax-deductible gift of at least $43 - or a monthly gift of $4, $10, $15, or $25. If you give $1000 or more, you&rsquo;ll also become a &quot;Ms.&rdquo; community lifetime member! </p>



<p></p>

<p>*Help &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; continue to make history!* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12256">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12256</a> ] &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; partners enable us to stay free of commercial ads so we can bring you the insightful and hard-hitting reporting you&rsquo;ve come to expect from &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to making history for women, </p>
