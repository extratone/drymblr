                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have a minute to lose - The extremist group Operation Rescue/Operation Save America has just announced plans to lead demonstrations against the South Wind Women&rsquo;s clinic in Wichita, Kansas during the January 22 anniversary of &ldquo;Roe v. Wade&rdquo;. And after that, they head to New Orleans in February. </p>

<p>*Please give today* *to help us keep embattled clinics open.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP15email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP15email</a> ] </p>



<p>Over half of all abortion clinics and doctors the Feminist Majority Foundation recently surveyed are reporting a surge in severe threats by anti-abortion extremists. Our survey reveals an alarming rise in stalking, cyber stalking, and use of WANTED-style flyers with the photos, personal information, and home addresses of clinic doctors and staff. In the past, these types of tactics have preceded deadly attacks on doctors by anti-abortion extremists. </p>

<p>Enough is enough. The Feminist Majority Foundation is on the front lines fighting back against extremists to keep abortion accessible. We monitor and warn clinics about extremist threats, work with law enforcement to prevent violence wherever we can, and provide security assistance to keep doctors and clinic workers safe. </p>



<p>*But we can&rsquo;t do this without your help.
