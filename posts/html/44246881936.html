9th Annual National Young Feminist Leadership Conference March 23-25, 2013 [ <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/">http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/</a> ]Dear Dry, </p>

<p>The Campus Team is hard at work preparing for this year&rsquo;s 9th Annual Young Feminist Leadership Conference [ <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/">http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/</a> ], and we are excited to announce that a tentative schedule [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/leadership/2013NYFLC/agenda.asp">http://feministcampus.org/leadership/2013NYFLC/agenda.asp</a> ] of assemblies, workshops, and skill building sessions is now available on our conference website [ <a href="http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/">http://www.feministcampus.org/leadership/</a> ]! </p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Tina Tchen, Chief of Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama and Executive Director of the White House Council on Women and Girls, will be our featured speaker during our Town Hall! She will be providing crucial information on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and will be available to answer any questions you have about how it will impact you and your state. </p>

<p>Some of the other featured speakers will include: <br/>
  * Terry O'Neill, President of the National Organization for Women <br/>
  * Claire Coleman, President and CEO of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association <br/>
  * Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farmworkers and receipient of the highest civil award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom </p>



<p>If you have not already registered for the conference [ <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=76709">https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=76709</a> ], make sure you do so NOW! You don&rsquo;t want to miss our incredible line up of influential women&rsquo;s rights leaders and activists, as well as the opportunity to network with other feminists from around the country and refine your activism skills during our dynamic skill-building sessions! </p>

<p>The conference will be held at the Double Tree Hotel in Crystal City, where we have reserved a block of rooms at a discounted rate. The deadline to reserve a room with this special rate is next Friday, March 8th, so make sure to book your room before it&rsquo;s too late [ <a href="http://bit.ly/XQjjwo">http://bit.ly/XQjjwo</a> ]! If you are traveling on your own and are looking to share a room with another conference attendee, we encourage you to use the Room Share message board on our Facebook page [ <a href="http://on.fb.me/Wi8eBi">http://on.fb.me/Wi8eBi</a> ]. </p>

<p>Finally, please consider staying Sunday night to participate in our Congressional Visit Day on Capitol Hill. We know that some of you have classes on Monday, but no trip to Washington D.C. is complete without a visit to Congress. This is great opportunity to meet with your Congressional Representatives and staff, and to gain experience lobbying for equal rights! </p>

<p>We also encourage those of you who intend to stay to put your activism skills to work on Tuesday, March 26th and Wednesday March 27th, during a rally outside of the Supreme Court as they hear arguments on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and California&rsquo;s Proposition 8. This will be a chance to be a part of a historic moment in our nation&rsquo;s history and to show support for marriage equality! </p>

<p>If you have any questions, or would like more information about registering as a group, please contact the Campus Team at nyflc@feminist.org [ mailto:nyflc@feminist.org ]! </p>
