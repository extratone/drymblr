                    <p>Hi Drywall </p>

<p>I know&hellip;.it&rsquo;s been a long time since the last newsletter, but I do have a genuine reason - we&rsquo;ve been manically busy helping people get revenge.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got so many plans and ideas but our priority has always been to help people get revenge on their ex, so things like our Facebook Page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/getrevengeonyourex">https://www.facebook.com/getrevengeonyourex</a>) and Twitter updates have sadly fallen by the wayside.</p>

<p>With that said, the new site and new products are developing nicely, so we&rsquo;ve not taken our eye off the ball but helping you has to be our number 1 priority - and I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p>

<p>Over the years, as much as we hate to say it, we&rsquo;ve realised that getting actual revenge isn&rsquo;t for everyone &hellip; I know, shocking, isn&rsquo;t it!!! :-) :-)</p>

<p>And yet, we get literally thousands of visitors to our site each week, all looking for a way to get back at their ex and at the same time move on with their lives.</p>

<p>We know that getting revenge works - we&rsquo;ve even commissioned reports and studies on why revenge is a perfectly healthy and natural emotional response, but we are big enough and ugly enough to accept that sometimes people want to simply move on as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>And we know that moving on is not easy and there is no magic cure for getting over an ex who has treated you like absolute crap&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;or so we thought!</p>

<p>You see, a couple of months ago we discovered this site: Lonely You</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that the site looks a bit naff, but we were intrigued enough to actually try this &ldquo;Get Over Your Ex Quick&rdquo; product.</p>

<p>Once we&rsquo;d downloaded the product, we were (if I&rsquo;m being honest with you) all ready to complete rip it apart and laugh at it&rsquo;s inferiority (hey, what can I say, we&rsquo;ve been told to leave Alex The Techie alone while he rebuilds the site, so we have to get our kicks somewhere!), but do you know what - there are some real pearls of wisdom here but, as we did with our voodoo spell experiment, we took some of your fellow members to one side (121 to be precise) and asked them to apply the techniques within the book.</p>

<p>Now, these fellow members were specifically chosen as they had become members but, shock-upon-shock, decided that our revenge tactics weren&rsquo;t really what they were comfortable with.</p>

<p>After 2 weeks we got their collective feedback and all but 3 of them stated that &ldquo;yhep, we&rsquo;ve moved on&rdquo;. More incredibly, is that 102 of them said that they felt they had moved on within 48 hours, even though the average length of their relationship had been 6 years (well, 6 years 2 months to be precise).</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t quite believe them if I&rsquo;m being honest - we&rsquo;d read the same book and wondered whether or not these responses were just to do with an initial feel good factor. Therefore, last week we contacted this focus group again (which was 11 weeks after they first read the book and started to apply the techniques) to see if they wanted to change their initial responses.</p>

<p>As we expected (insert evil laugh), there was some relapse &hellip; but only 1 person!! (replace evil laugh with humble pie)</p>

<p>To save you reaching for the calculator, that means that out of the 121 people we tested the product on, 117 moved on within 2 weeks, without relapse after 3 months!</p>

<p>So, what can we conclude from this. Well, based upon our little trial, we have discovered that:</p>

<p>getting actual revenge may not be for everyone</p>

<p>for those who are not comfortable with our revenge tactics but need to move on as quickly as possible, there is a solution</p>

<p>and the solution actually works</p>

<p>So, if this sounds like you, then we strongly recommend the Lonely You website (just ignore the naff layout)</p>

<p>And for those of you who want to twist the knife before moving on, then you know where we are ;-) </p>

<p>Oh, and one last thing &hellip; just in case you were wondering why we chose 121 people, it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s my house number!</p>

<p>See you soon,</p>
