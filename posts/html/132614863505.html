                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>When Ms. magazine launched, the pundits were predicting the magazine would run out of things to say in 6 issues. Well, 43 years later, our reporting and truth-telling still fills the pages of what&rsquo;s been called one of the most influential magazines in U.S. history. That&rsquo;s right-this fall, Ms. turns 43! </p>



<p>We need your help to make sure Ms. stays strong and independent. I&rsquo;m inviting you to join in a very dedicated group of members, out Ms. Partners, and inviting you to join our Ms.lifetime community member circle. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPartnerEmail">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPartnerEmail</a> ]</p>



<p>Because Ms. doesn&rsquo;t take commercial advertisements, you never have to worry that we will shy away from telling it like it is. From shocking Supreme Court decisions allowing bosses to decide their women employees&rsquo; birth control…to campus sexual assault…to the War on Women, Ms. is the leader in reporting our lives.</p>



<p>Just like public radio, we depend on our partners and readers to keep Ms. strong! So, while this email is in front of you, please act to support us. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPartnerEmail">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPartnerEmail</a> ]</p>



<p>There are two ways to become a Ms. Partner-you can make a one-time tax-deductible gift of $43 or more (a dollar for every year of Ms. and its truth-telling and trailblazing), or join our monthly sustainer program-at $10, $15 or $25 or more a month. With a donation of $1,000 or more, you will become a lifetime member of the Ms.community. </p>



<p>And a special thanks, we will list both Ms. partners and lifetime members in our upcoming Ms. anniversary issue. </p>



<p>Dry, we hope you will become a Ms. partner or a lifetime community member. Help us reach our goal of 343 new partners by the end of our anniversary drive!

<p>Over the years, our covers have featured Wonder Woman walking tall and strong-just like Ms. But for Ms. to stay strong we need to know we can count on the support of a dedicated group of members-literally our Partners. </p>



<p>Become a Ms. Partner and/or lifetime community member today, and see your name in Ms.!

<p>Here&rsquo;s to our future, </p>
