                                    <h1>Take Action on Roe - We Won't Go Back!</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>We need you to *take a stand for women&rsquo;s health in honor of &ldquo;Roe&rdquo; [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989</a> ]*. </p>



<p>The House of Representatives plans to vote on a 20-week abortion ban this Thursday, January 22 – the anniversary of &ldquo;Roe v. Wade&rdquo;. This extremist bill, one that would ban abortion pre-viability, is a direct attack on &ldquo;Roe&rdquo;. A similar ban in Arizona was deemed unconstitutional by a federal appeals court, and the Supreme Court refused to review that decision – letting stand that the 20-week ban is unconstitutional. </p>

<p>*We have to make sure that Members of Congress know that the majority of Americans support safe, legal abortion. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989</a> ]* </p>



<p></p>

<p>The fact that the Republican-controlled House would – on the anniversary of &ldquo;Roe &quot;– push forward an unconstitutional bill to deny women the right to an abortion is an outrage. </p>



<p>*But we will not go back – here are 5 things you can do to celebrate &quot;Roe &quot;and help make abortion and birth control accessible:* </p>
