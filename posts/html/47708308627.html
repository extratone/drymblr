                    <p>Feminist Majority Foundation - Equality around the world </p>

<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We have great news! A group of abortion rights supporters in Wichita, Kansas, called the Trust Women Foundation have purchased, renovated, and have just opened a comprehensive reproductive health clinic â€“ the South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center - in the former clinic of Dr. Tiller, who was assassinated in his church by an anti-abortion extremist four years ago. </p>

<p>But the new clinic needs our help. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9866">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9866</a> ] </p>

<p>Even before it opened, the staff was being harassed and threatened. Executive Director Julie Burkhart, who previously worked for Dr. Tiller is being stalked and her home is being picketed. A huge sign was placed in Julie&rsquo;s yard asking &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your church?&rdquo;-not a very subtle threat considering where Dr. Tiller was murdered. </p>

<p>Enough is Enough! The South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center and its brave staff needs more security support. Will you give $5, $25, $100, $500 or $5,000 today to help provide desperately needed security measures for the South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center and staff?  [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9866">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9866</a> ] </p>

<p>The new Wichita clinic needs our help! The Feminist Majority Foundation clinic defense team has been helping the new clinic in many different ways. Our team has traveled to Wichita several times and spent weeks on the ground helping obtain security and build community support. We will continue to help and we wanted to give you and all of our supporters an opportunity to help. We cannot let the terrorists win!</p>

<p>FMF staff has been on the ground in Wichita working closely with the clinic and providing direct emergency assistance. </p>

<p>I know you too will want to stand up for the South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center. Please donate today to provide critical protection for the clinic and its brave doctors and staff. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9866">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9866</a> ] Your contribution will go directly to the clinic and personnel security measures. Let the staff know they are not alone and that people all over this nation won&rsquo;t let the terrorists win. </p>

<p>Remember the South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center provides not only abortion services, but also birth control, well women exams, prenatal care, cancer screenings, STIs testing and much more. Without courageous women&rsquo;s health care providers-there will be no choice for women. Please help the South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center today. </p>
