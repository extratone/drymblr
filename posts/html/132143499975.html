                    <p>Dear Dry,</p>

<p><br/>
The Feminist Majority is thrilled to announce that Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and president of Whole Woman&rsquo;s Health, will receive our Courage Award at the 2015 Women, Money, Power Summit on November 5 in Washington, DC. You won&rsquo;t want to miss it!</p>

<p><br/>
As the lead plaintiff in the legal challenge against Texas&rsquo; restrictive abortion law, known as House Bill 2, Hagstrom Miller has been on the frontlines defending abortion access. The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to hear the case, Whole Woman&rsquo;s Health v. Cole, the most significant challenge to abortion access to come before the Court in many years.</p>

<p><br/>
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be inspired by Hagstrom Miller, as well as our other notable honorees, including Congresswomen Louise Slaughter, Barbara Lee, and Donna Edwards. </p>

For Equality,</p>
