                                    <h1>Violent Threats Against Abortion Clinics Nearly DOUBLED</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>The Feminist Majority Foundation just released a new survey that reveals 1 in 5 abortion clinics are the target of severe violence. As we mark today&rsquo;s 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, abortion clinics around the country are struggling to stay open. </p>

<p>*Please give today* *to support our work to help targeted clinics stay open.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP15email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12737&amp;oqd-sourcecode=NCAP15email</a> ] </p>



<p>The incidence of severe threats against clinics from extremists has almost doubled - from 27% to 52%. Our survey reveals an alarming rise in stalking, cyber stalking, and use of WANTED-style flyers with the photos, personal information, and home addresses of clinic doctors and staff. In the past, these types of tactics have preceded deadly attacks on doctors by anti-abortion extremists. </p>
