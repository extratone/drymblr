                                    <h1>TAKE ACTION: Stop the War on Planned Parenthood</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry,</p>

<p>*The outrageous attacks on Planned Parenthood must stop. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538</a> ]*</p>

<p>This time, heavily-edited sham videos – made by a deceptive group calling itself the Center for Medical Progress – have distorted what Planned Parenthood does. On the basis of these sham videos, CMP, together with Troy Newman, the President of Operation Rescue, are calling for an immediate defunding of Planned Parenthood for the so-called &ldquo;selling&rdquo; of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood does not sell fetal tissue - although with a patient&rsquo;s consent and in accordance with federal law, clinics may donate tissue to contribute to life-saving medical research - but CMP and Operation Rescue are using every excuse you can think of to defund Planned Parenthood. *We must stop them. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538</a> ]*</p>

<p>Right now the fight is in the Senate. Wanna-be presidents, Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY) have already called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood.</p>

<p>*We must let our Senators know that they must vote NO on defunding Planned Parenthood [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538</a> ]** *and YES to increase funding for women&rsquo;s health care services. Every dollar the U.S. government spent on publicly funded family planning services in 2010, saved $7.09 in Medicaid and other public expenditures, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by these sham videos! In case you&rsquo;ve never heard of Operation Rescue, it has been engaging in a campaign of terror, harassment, and intimidation against abortion providers, patients, and clinic staff for years. Its second-in-command, Cheryl Sullenger, spent time in prison for attempting to bomb a San Diego, California clinic in 1988. Her number was found in the car of Scott Roeder, who participated in Operation Rescue events in Wichita, Kansas, and was later found guilty of the murder of Wichita abortion provider Dr. George Tiller. Operation Rescue had moved to Wichita under the leadership of Troy Newman to close Dr. Tiller&rsquo;s clinic. Newman is now on the board of CMP.</p>

<p>*Email your Senators now and tell them to stand with women, not extremists. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538</a> ]** [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11538</a> ]* Tell them to vote NO on defunding Planned Parenthood. No more extremist attacks on women&rsquo;s health.</p>
