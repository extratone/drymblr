<p>We Want To Hear From You: WHAT DID DANCING DO?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dancing insists we take up space, and though it has no set direction,<br/>
we go there together. Dance is dangerous, joyous, sexual, holy,<br/>
disruptive, and contagious and it breaks the rules. It can happen<br/>
anywhere, at anytime, with anyone and everyone, and it&rsquo;s free. Dance<br/>
joins us and pushes us to go further and that is why it&rsquo;s at the<br/>
center of ONE BILLION RISING&rdquo; Eve Ensler.</p>

<p>As we prepare for ONE BILLION RISING FOR JUSTICE, for the escalation<br/>
and the deepening of the campaign, we want to take a quick look back<br/>
and ask What did dancing do?</p>

<p>We have seen the power of communities coming together through dance<br/>
and action.</p>

<p>Dance broke the silence in Somalia and new laws were passed in<br/>
Guatemala. It&rsquo;s unified groups, it&rsquo;s made people feel free, it&rsquo;s<br/>
broken down barriers.</p>

<p>Today we are asking you to please take a moment and share how dancing<br/>
affected you personally, and your community as a whole. The more<br/>
specific the better, tell us how dancing impacted your Rising in 2013.</p>

<p>We are compiling a recap of the power of dancing.  Your quotes and<br/>
photos may be used for social media, reports, or publication.</p>

<p>Please share a photo, as well as any other kind of multimedia you may<br/>
have from the day so we may attach at least one visual alongside your<br/>
quotes.</p>

<p>We appreciate your passion and activism and look forward to sharing<br/>
the final document with you once we have compiled the information you<br/>
send us.</p>

<p>SHARE what dancing did in your community &gt;<br/>
