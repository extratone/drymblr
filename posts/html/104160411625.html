<p>NEW SERIES LAUNCHES: &ldquo;Building to One Billion Rising REVOLUTION&rdquo;</p>

<p>1 in 3 women across the planet will be beaten or raped during her<br/>
lifetime. That&rsquo;s ONE BILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS. Every February, we rise<br/>
- in hundreds of countries across the world - to show our<br/>
local communities and the world what one billion looks like and shine<br/>
a light on the rampant impunity and injustice that survivors most<br/>
often face. We rise through dance to express joy and community and<br/>
celebrate the fact that we have not been defeated by this violence. We<br/>
rise to show we are determined to create a new kind of consciousness<br/>
- one where violence will be resisted until it is unthinkable.</p>

<p>This year we are rising for Revolution. We are initiating a new<br/>
series, &ldquo;Building to One Billion Rising Revolution&rdquo; where we will be<br/>
sharing stories of extraordinary activists who embody the creative<br/>
radical shift in consciousness required to bring about CHANGE.</p>

<p>Grassroots Activists who fight for justice and liberation with passion<br/>
and joy.</p>

<p>The series will appear in The Huffington Post</p>

<p>27% Is Too Many, But It&rsquo;s Also The Sign Of A Revolution<br/>

<p>I was fourteen years old when my mother and grandmother announced that<br/>
I was going to have my clitoris, my labia majora, and my labia minora<br/>
cut out. They said if I resisted, I would be a coward. In my culture,<br/>
the worst thing you can ever be called is a coward. What they did to<br/>
me next caused me real harm, but it also gave me the cause of my life.</p>
