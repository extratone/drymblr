<p>Dear Dry ,<br/>
Like many of you, I have become more and more frustrated by hearing statements from<br/>
politicians about rape and abortion. The worst were the gaffes and wrongful responses<br/>
made by &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; legislators regarding so-called &ldquo;exceptions&rdquo; that would allow<br/>
 abortions for rape, threat to the life of the mother, and for special needs babies.<br/>
Have they ever looked into the eyes of a mother who learned she conceived through<br/>
rape? Would they look into her child&rsquo;s eyes and say, you don&rsquo;t deserve to be here?<br/>
So we went on a mission&hellip;<br/>
This summer, equipped with our &ldquo;Pro-Woman Answers to Pro-Choice QuestionsTM&rdquo; and<br/>
 the stories of Remarkable Pro-Life Women® who shared their eye-opening testimony<br/>
in &ldquo;Hard Cases, Exceptional Choices,&rdquo; we quietly went to 160 legislative offices<br/>
 on Capitol Hill.<br/>
We educated the legislative staff and their bosses with pro-woman talking points,<br/>
the message that Women Deserve Better® than Abortion and what that means: holistic,<br/>
women-centered solutions.<br/>
We also gave legislators powerful feminist history quotes to use on the House and<br/>
Senate floors&ndash;gems of truth first revealed by FFL researchers.<br/>
Legislators&rsquo; need for these resources was obvious. The gratitude was palpable.<br/>
Now we want to go even further to reach policymakers who are Key Agents of Change:</p>

<p>* We want to reach more U.S. Representatives and Senators.</p>

<p>* And for the first time, we intend to provide state senators, delegates, and governors<br/>
with our pro-woman, pro-life messages, women&rsquo;s stories and Q &amp; A focusing on &ldquo;hard<br/>
cases,&rdquo; and our-soon-to-be-updated &ldquo;Pro-Woman Answers to Pro-Choice QuestionsTM&rdquo;!<br/>
These are the people who make policies, set priorities, pass laws, and allocate <br/>
funds&ndash;and many need our help to get it right for women and children at highest <br/>
risk. Looking ahead, some of these elected officials will one day run for higher<br/>
 offices, including the White House. The time for us to reach them is now.<br/>
FFL is uniquely qualified for this critical mission, and this is why we need your<br/>
support right now [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_OEr2Mf_ca8awAKjZUeysY45JrseAHuzHXYwTknnN78MvQbWCUfi3kOf7nVIupHOE9kE1UU1ue20viwnywlBSelUvsG9N9H1RYEcHt3bx1JIIpdfB9hrktJcdIQm-_YLubnYMeaYXfC67j5FLaw8Bw==].<br/>
For two decades, Feminists for Life has taken on the issue of violence against women&ndash;including<br/>
rape andabortion. In addition, we have produced numerous issues of The American <br/>
Feministdevoted to the subject (&ldquo;Victory Over Violence,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forward Into Light,&rdquo; and<br/>
&ldquo;Hard Cases&rdquo;). And since 2008, FFL speaker Joyce McCauley-Benner has shared her <br/>
story annually on Capitol Hill and on campuses about surviving rape that resulted<br/>
in pregnancy&ndash;and how she chose victory over violence.<br/>
Mary Meehan documented our leadership position on this issue in an opinion editorial,<br/>
&ldquo;Rape and Abortion: A Double Injustice, published in the Human Life Review:<br/>
Feminists for Life of America has been dealing with rape and abortion for many years.<br/>
&quot;We will never trade one form of violence for another,&rdquo; says FFL President Serrin<br/>
Foster. She champions both the federal Violence Against Woman Act and pro-life legislation<br/>
[Laci and Conner&rsquo;s Law]. She calls abortion &ldquo;a second act of violence against a <br/>
woman who is raped,&rdquo; and she quotes a medical student who said her abortion &ldquo;was<br/>
 worse than the rape.&rdquo; Foster declares: &ldquo;Both victims&ndash;the woman and her child&ndash;deserve<br/>
our unconditional support.&rdquo;<br/>
Mary also cited statistics from the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology<br/>
that 8,000 mothers in this country keep children who are conceived in rape every<br/>
 year. Another 6% of the 25,000 women who become pregnant from rape choose adoption.<br/>
For the last two decades, FFL has provided legislative solutions to prevent violence<br/>
and to protect survivors.<br/>
The next step is to educate and influence legislators by helping them listen to <br/>
women. By providing them with our pro-woman policies and answers, we can prevent<br/>
 more cruel misstatements and votes against both victims.<br/>
You may know that FFL Vice President Sally Winn has been working on this issue in<br/>
her state and helped to pass a law to protect women from rapists who seek visitation<br/>
and even custody of the children they fathered as a result of sexual assault.<br/>
This weekend Sally will speak at Yale University.  This is important because the<br/>
 hideous gaffes are not just being made by legislators. Yale now calls rape &ldquo;nonconsensual<br/>
sex,&rdquo; thus minimizing the violence.<br/>
FFL&rsquo;s credentials are why legislators&ndash;and college students and administrators&ndash;listen<br/>
to us.<br/>
There are nearly 8,000 U.S. and state lawmakers we can reach&ndash;and provide them with<br/>
the tools they need to stop the ongoing discrimination against the more than 8,000<br/>
rape survivors each year who choose to keep their children, and the 1,500 rape survivors<br/>
who choose adoption.<br/>
As a stakeholder in our work, you can reach these key agents of change [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_OEr2Mf_ca8awAKjZUeysY45JrseAHuzHXYwTknnN78MvQbWCUfi3kOf7nVIupHOE9kE1UU1ue20viwnywlBSelUvsG9N9H1RYEcHt3bx1JIIpdfB9hrktJcdIQm-_YLubnYMeaYXfC67j5FLaw8Bw==].<br/>
You can choose to help us reach today&rsquo;s leaders in Congress, state legislators, <br/>
or leaders on campus. Or you can refuse to choose and support both initiatives. <br/>
Both choices will support women and support life.<br/>
We need to raise $50,000 to underwrite our efforts to reach today&rsquo;s legislators <br/>
at the state and federal level&ndash;and also equip tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders who are leading<br/>
the efforts now on college campuses&ndash;with our soon to be released updated issue <br/>
of &ldquo;Pro-Woman Answers to Pro-Choice Questions&rdquo; and our other materials.<br/>
I ask you to please carefully consider how much you can contribute to underwrite<br/>
 this important next step as we work to end violence and discrimination against <br/>
the most vulnerable.  [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_OEr2Mf_ca8awAKjZUeysY45JrseAHuzHXYwTknnN78MvQbWCUfi3kOf7nVIupHOE9kE1UU1ue20viwnywlBSelUvsG9N9H1RYEcHt3bx1JIIpdfB9hrktJcdIQm-_YLubnYMeaYXfC67j5FLaw8Bw==]<br/>
Because women deserve better,<br/>
Serrin M. Foster<br/>
President</p>
