<p>Book Description:<br/>
Playwright, author, and activist Eve Ensler has devoted her life to<br/>
the female body-how to talk about it, how to protect and value<br/>
it. Yet she spent much of her life disassociated from her own<br/>
body-a disconnection brought on by her father&rsquo;s sexual abuse and<br/>
her mother&rsquo;s remoteness. &ldquo;;Because I did not, could not inhabit my<br/>
body or the Earth,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;I could not feel or know their pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ensler is shocked out of her distance. While working in the Congo,<br/>
she is shattered to encounter the horrific rape and violence inflicted<br/>
on the women there. Soon after, she is diagnosed with uterine cancer,<br/>
and through months of harrowing treatment, she is forced to become<br/>
first and foremost a body-pricked, punctured, cut, scanned. It<br/>
is then that all distance is erased. As she connects her own illness<br/>
to the devastation of the earth, her life force to the resilience of<br/>
humanity, she is finally, fully-and gratefully-joined to<br/>
the body of the world.</p>

<p>Unflinching, generous, and inspiring, Ensler calls on us all to embody<br/>
our connection to and responsibility for the world.</p>

<p>A MOMENT OF CLARITY<br/>
by Jason Sywak, Campaign Project Manager<br/>
I am not an expert in the anti-violence against women movement. Of<br/>
course, I knew it existed and that laws don&rsquo;t do enough to punish<br/>
offenders or protect victims but I had no idea how much of a global<br/>
epidemic violence against women is&hellip;<br/>
