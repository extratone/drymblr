                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>This holiday season, Ms. Magazine is offering us a free copy [ <a href="http://msmagazine.com/fall2013/sexsegregation.asp">http://msmagazine.com/fall2013/sexsegregation.asp</a> ] of an exciting new article by Susan McGee Bailey, former Director of the Wellesley Centers for Women, on the increased sex-segregation in public K-12 schools and how it harms students and undermines equality. </p>

<p>The article [ <a href="http://msmagazine.com/fall2013/sexsegregation.asp">http://msmagazine.com/fall2013/sexsegregation.asp</a> ] appears in the Fall 2013 issue of Ms., and it is a must-read. Let&rsquo;s resolve to make lots of use of this gift! </p>

<p>This valuable article is also being included in Ms. in the Classroom. Visit our website [ <a href="http://msintheclassroom.com/">http://msintheclassroom.com/</a> ] or email Ms. in the Classroom Director Karon Jolna [ mailto:kjolna@msmagazine.com ] to see how you can add Ms. to your courses. Educators receive free digital access and instructors&rsquo; guides for each issue. </p>

<p>Of course, you can also access additional information and resources on Title IX and education equality anytime on Feminist Majority Foundation&rsquo;s website [ <a href="http://feminist.org/education/SexSegregation.asp">http://feminist.org/education/SexSegregation.asp</a> ]. </p>

<p>Looking forward to a wonderful new year with lots of success in advancing gender equality in and through education. And remember to share this important new article with your networks through social media and email! </p>
