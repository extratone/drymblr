<p>Support Our Syrian Sisters in Lebanon</p>

<p>The ongoing Civil War in Syria has lead to hundreds of thousands of<br/>
refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. As history has taught us,<br/>
the rate of violence against women and girls escalates dramatically in<br/>
times of conflict, and as the war continues and the stability of<br/>
refugee camps and local infrastructure deteriorates, women and girls<br/>
are suffering.<br/>
