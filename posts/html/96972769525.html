<p>ADOPT A PRO-LIFE STUDENT GROUP:</p>

<p>HELP THEM START A REVOLUTION FOR LIFE</p>

<p>Send a Kit, Speaker or</p>

<p>Pregnancy Resource Forum Moderator to Campus!</p>

<p>Every day that goes by another woman will suffer an abortion and another child will<br/>
die. But you and I can reach her before she crosses the threshold of the clinic <br/>
door, before she lays her body down, before that child is lost forever.</p>

<p>Student leaders are eager for FFL kits to help grow their group and reach abortion-minded<br/>
women. They are already asking for speakers, FFL Pregnancy Resource ForumTM moderators<br/>
and kits. In fact, we already have dozens of events in the works across the country<br/>
now!</p>

<p>We urgently need to get Feminists for Life kits to every pro-woman, pro-life student<br/>
group in the country</p>
