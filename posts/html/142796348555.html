Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We need your help now. *Tell the House Select Panel investigating abortion providers to either redirect its focus to anti-abortion violence or to disband. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845</a> ]*</p>

<p>In a potentially dangerous move, the Panel&rsquo;s Chairwoman has subpoenaed abortion clinic records-including the names of doctors and clinic personnel-even as threats against clinics mount. Some of these threats and violence are apparently inspired by deceptively-edited videos, created and released by the fraudulent Center for Medical Progress (CMP), which falsely accused Planned Parenthood of selling &ldquo;baby parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These outrageous and now discredited videos were the initial justification for the creation of the House Panel, but now investigations completed in 12 states and in three Congressional committees have found no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood. *It is clear that the House Select Investigative Panel was created on a false premise and must redirect its focus now, before more violence occurs. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845</a> ]*</p>

<p>Just this past November, Robert Dear killed three people and wounded nine outside a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood. After his arrest, Dear told authorities that he wanted to stop the selling of &ldquo;baby parts.&rdquo; Court documents released this week reveal that Dear is a longtime anti-abortion extremist and an admirer of Paul Hill, another anti-abortion extremist who was convicted of murdering a doctor and his escort outside a Pensacola, Florida clinic in 1994. </p>

<p>*So far, however, the House Panel has been unwilling to investigate escalating threats and violence against abortion providers. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845</a> ]* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845</a> ]</p>

<p>Meanwhile, yesterday, a group called Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust demonstrated against California Attorney General Kamala Harris for launching a state investigation of CMP leader David Daleiden-even though a Houston, Texas grand jury, convened by an anti-abortion prosecutor, recently indicted Daleiden and a CMP employee on felony criminal charges related to their CMP activities. The demonstration was promoted with the hashtag</p>

<p>The Survivors are an extremist anti-abortion group that announced in August 2015 the &ldquo;Birth of the Irregulars,&rdquo; describing &ldquo;Irregulars&rdquo; as &ldquo;soldiers or warriors who are members of special organizations that employ irregular military tactics &hellip; . [and who] will excel at scouting out Planned Parenthood events, skirmishing at, harassing, pursuing, and sabotaging Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s evil plans at every turn.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Operation Rescue President Troy Newman, who was a founding official of CMP, is a featured speaker and a trainer at Survivor events.  *The House Select Investigative Panel should call both Daleiden and Newman to answer questions under oath about their activities. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18845</a> ]*</p>

<p>The time is long overdue for the House Select Panel to investigate the makers of the fraudulent videos and to study how to reduce violence, threats, and harassment at women&rsquo;s reproductive health clinics. </p>
