<p>* This bilingual story <http:> is a celebration of a little biracial, Peruvian-Scottish-American girl who refuses to be put in a box and confidently embraces her mixed heritage. The beautiful illustrations feature kids of different cultures and colors, and lots of fun details about multicultural life. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Up and Down <http:> is an interactive storybook app uses a split screen format to take kids through a day in the life of two very different children—one in the western Sahara desert and the other in the Western world—and demonstrates the commonalities that tie kids around the world together. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Amazon Prime is piloting a bunch of new children&rsquo;s series. Our favorite is Sara Solves It <http:>, a math-focused detective show starring a brown brother-sister duo, set in what seems to be NYC, and featuring and a culturally-diverse cast of kids. (More about it here <http:>.) I love that culture isn&rsquo;t the show&rsquo;s primary focus, but rather it&rsquo;s just about curious, smart kids who happen to be brown.
