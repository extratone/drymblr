<p>* I thought it nearly impossible to out-parody sites such as Buzzfeed, Gawker, and all the other viral news sites, but the staff of The Onion has nailed it, particularly with this shocking three-hour-video of a stick of butter left out at room temperature <http:>. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* I&rsquo;m not sure where these photographs come from or who&rsquo;s running the site, but at Internet K-Hole (what does that even mean?!) there is a limitless supply of found photos from the 70s and 80s <http:>.

<p>* &ldquo;The Best Show&rdquo; was a music and comedy radio show put out by New York&rsquo;s WFMU for over fifteen years. There are literally thousands of hours available for download <http:>, and all of them for free. Along with sidekick Jon Wurster, host Tom Scharpling produced comedy similar to a modern update of the classic comedy team Bob and Ray. Surreal and brilliant, and always surprising.
