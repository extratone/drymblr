                                    <h1>JOIN ME: Show DV Survivors and Women in Prison That We Remember Them</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Out of sight may mean out of mind – and heart. </p>

<p>For women in prison, this is the tragedy. For the rest of us, this invisibility keeps us from realizing how much women in prison resemble you and me. Most women in prison are not a danger to society – about 70 percent are locked up for nonviolent offenses. The majority of women prisoners have dependent children and about 5 percent will give birth behind bars. Black women are twice as likely as white women to be incarcerated. </p>

<p>Knowing such facts is a first step to action. That&rsquo;s why we at Ms. magazine decided that reporting was not enough and launched the Ms. Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=13000&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPDV2015">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=13000&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPDV2015</a> ] </p>

<p>We send Ms. to 5,233 federal, state and county prisoners – a fraction of the total, but a number we&rsquo;re proud of. And because domestic violence shelters can almost be as isolating, we send the magazine to hundreds of shelters, too. </p>

<p>The program is funded by raising charitable contributions, and asking Ms. Community Members to buy an extra membership for a friend they don&rsquo;t know. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=13000&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPDV2015">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=13000&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPDV2015</a> ] Your support will help us reach even more women. </p>

<p>Ms. has received hundreds of letters from incarcerated women explaining why the program is so important to them. They tell us Ms. keeps them strong and confident while they live out their sentences, and motivates them to do important work for others upon release. </p>

<p>Let women on the inside know we&rsquo;re not forgetting. And let women in shelters know that we know it&rsquo;s unfair for them to be deprived of home, for their own safety, while the criminal is free. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=13000&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPDV2015">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=13000&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MsPDV2015</a> ] </p>

<p>We must keep working against the Prison Industrial Complex that benefits only corporations building and running prisons for profit. We must all work against the attitudes that have turned the home into the single most dangerous place for women and children. </p>

<p>If you would like the deep satisfaction of knowing you&rsquo;ve made a vulnerable woman feel less alone, please make a tax-deductible donation today to ensure women in prisons and domestic violence shelters continue to feel supported and acknowledged.

<p>With friendship, </p>

<p>Gloria Steinem </p>

<p>PS: Sending a friend you don&rsquo;t know a copy of Ms. will provide her with hundreds of pages of words and images that link her to the world of women. Give now!
