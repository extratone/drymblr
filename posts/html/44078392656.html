<p>U.S. College Students, Parents &amp; Alumnae: RISE - THIS IS THE<br/>
MOMENT</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=hbYGAeGEpnEG4VadWHKq3w">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=hbYGAeGEpnEG4VadWHKq3w</a></p>

<p>The energy from ONE BILLION RISING continues with immediate action<br/>
steps!</p>

<p>This week the House of Representatives will be voting on their version<br/>
of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).</p>

<p>Women&rsquo;s groups, advocates, and survivors have worked to show<br/>
support for the inclusive, bipartisan Senate-passed bill,<br/>
S. 47, and are asking House members to oppose the alternate version<br/>
which will be brought to the House floor for a vote as early as THIS<br/>
WEDNESDAY! Our work is far from over.</p>

<p>The alternate version of VAWA falls short of our goals for VAWA.<br/>
Action must be taken this week to show support for the INCLUSIVE,<br/>
SENATE PASSED version.</p>

<p>WHY this is important for students, parents and alumna:</p>

<p>The alternate version of VAWA drops important provisions in the Senate<br/>
bill including provisions to strengthen protections and security<br/>
for students on college campuses. It also drops the Senate-passed<br/>
initiative to erase rape kit backlogs and other provisions found in<br/>
the SAFER Act.</p>

<p>This new version also fails by:</p>

<p>*  Dropping the reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims<br/>
Protection Act;<br/>
*  Omitting the Senate-passed LGBT provisions;  <br/>
*  Providing non-tribal batterers with additional tools to delay<br/>
and frustrate swift justice in tribal court systems;<br/>
gratuitously restricting existing tribal authority to issue<br/>
civil orders of protection against all abusers - which is<br/>
currently the only local recourse Native women have against<br/>
non-Indian abusers;<br/>
*  Weakening the ability of the Office on Violence Against Women to<br/>
serve as the effective hub for carrying out VAWA&rsquo;s<br/>
mission.</p>

<p>Starting TODAY, we are encouraging you to flood your<br/>
representative&rsquo;s telephone lines and email inboxes with messages<br/>
of support for S. 47, the inclusive, bipartisan Senate-passed version<br/>
of VAWA and the demand that they vote against the House Republican<br/>
leadership&rsquo;s imitation VAWA.</p>
