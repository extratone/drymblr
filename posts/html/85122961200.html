<p>TAKE ACTION: - &ldquo;We Are Not Going Anywhere&rdquo; by<br/>
Barbara Mhangami-Ruwende</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, 234 teenage girls were kidnapped in the Nigerian city<br/>
of Bornu while taking their exams. It is assumed that the girls were<br/>
taken by Boko Haram, a local Islamic extremist group whose name means<br/>
&ldquo;western education is forbidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is feared that the girls have been sold into marriage to the<br/>
militants and some have been moved to nearby countries of Cameroon and<br/>
Chad. The global movement of activists behind and<br/>
countless One Billion Rising organizers and participants have been<br/>
working tirelessly to bring the plight of the girls to the world&rsquo;s<br/>
attention.</p>

<p>One Billion Rising for Justice Global Coordinator (Southern Africa)<br/>
Barbara Mhangami-Ruwende shares what some activists are doing around<br/>
the world, and calls on all of us to:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a RESOUNDING RISING NOISE this Sunday, 11 May, and let the world<br/>
leaders know that we are not going anywhere, that we will not stop<br/>
until they!&rdquo;</p>
