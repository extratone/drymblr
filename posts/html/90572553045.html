<p>Last week&rsquo;s Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to strike down the Massachusetts&rsquo; clinic buffer zone law was a blow that could not have come at a worse time. </p>

<p><br/>
The Feminist Majority Foundation&rsquo;s National Clinic Access Project helps besieged and targeted clinics. *The summer is traditionally a tough time. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] **We need your help* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ]*. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ]*</p>

<p><br/>
Our team just returned from Orlando/Kissimmee, Florida area where clinics were targeted. We are working to keep targeted clinics open and safe in Wichita, KS, Albuquerque, NM, Nebraska, Texas, Maryland and upstate New York. Right now we are preparing to help clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi.  </p>

<p><br/>
We fear that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling will embolden extremists. Anti-abortion extremists&rsquo; websites are crowing about their &ldquo;huge victory&rdquo; and predicting that remaining buffer zone laws across the country will be wiped out. *We can&rsquo;t let that happen.* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ]</p>

<p><br/>
Our work to defend abortion clinics has become even more difficult. *That&rsquo;s why we are asking for your support. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ]* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] Clinics in many states are besieged. </p>

<p><br/>
In June, our team traveled to New Orleans and Baton Rouge to conduct clinic security assessments, recruited and trained volunteer clinic escorts and legal observers.  </p>

<p><br/>
Our team is now preparing to return to New Orleans, and together with local supporters, volunteers, escorts and legal observers, *will work to keep the clinics safe and open [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ]* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227</a> ] during a week-long Operation Rescue/Operation Save America July event attracting anti-abortion extremists nationwide. </p>

<p><br/>
After New Orleans, our team will travel to Jackson, Mississippi, for the trial of anti-abortion extremist Chet Gallagher who was arrested earlier at the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization, the only clinic that remains open in Mississippi. We will make sure the clinic stays open when anti-abortion extremists gather for the trial.</p>
