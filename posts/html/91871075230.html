<p>RISE for Peace and an Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza</p>

<p>We - ONE BILLION RISING - a world movement of women and men working to<br/>
end violence against women and girls, and all the intersectional<br/>
injustices that sustain the impunity that keep it in place - call for<br/>
an immediate ceasefire. We call for an end to the occupation of<br/>
Palestine and all forms of oppression that lead to more violence.</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=0G4Rw3RcI2N55NFa2Pq9dw">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=0G4Rw3RcI2N55NFa2Pq9dw</a></p>

<p>Already countless civilians have died - many of whom are women and<br/>
children.</p>

<p>We cry with and rise for the mothers who have lost their children and<br/>
families and who live in daily terror in this ongoing war.</p>

<p>We cry with those that have been occupied and diminished and who are<br/>
seeking recourse.</p>

<p>We know that our sisters on both sides long for connection, justice<br/>
and peace.</p>

<p>And we stand in solidarity with the women and men of Palestine and<br/>
peace loving people of Israel who demand an end to the bombings and<br/>
air strikes now.</p>
