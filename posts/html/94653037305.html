<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p><br/>
Support Clinics! [ org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11227 ] *Become a &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; <br/>
Partner today! [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ]* *<br/>

<p><br/>
Over the years, our covers have featured Wonder Woman - a truthteller, just like&quot; Ms. &ldquo;Our reporting has made headlines, made history and changed lives. But none of that would have been possible without support from readers and activists like you. </p>

<p>*I&rsquo;m inviting you to join a dedicated group of members, our &quot;Ms.&rdquo; Partners. And you can join our &ldquo;Ms. &quot;lifetime community member circle. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=11287</a> ] *As a special thanks, we will list your name as a &quot;Ms.&rdquo; Partner or lifetime member in our fall &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; Anniversary issue. </p>

<p>You can become a &ldquo;Ms. &quot;Partner by making a one-time tax-deductible gift of $42 or more - one dollar for every year of &quot;Ms. &quot;and its trailblazing. Or you can make a recurring gift of over $10 a month. With a donation of $1000 or more, you will also become a lifetime member of the &quot;Ms. &quot;community. </p>

<p>A long-time &quot;Ms.&rdquo; reader has pledged a $25,000 challenge grant if we get 342 new &ldquo;Ms. &quot;Partners before the end of our drive - but we have less than two weeks left! *Help us reach our goal.

<p>Here&rsquo;s to our future, </p>
