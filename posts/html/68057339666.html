                                    <h1>We're half way there -- help Mississippi's last clinic!</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re already half way to our goal of $5,000 to help update the security system at Mississippi&rsquo;s last abortion clinic, but we need your help today to finish strong. </p>

<p>Please donate today to help the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10526">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10526</a> ] 100% of your tax-deductible donation will go to upgrading the clinic&rsquo;s security system. </p>

<p>Dry, this funding is badly needed to help protect the clinic&rsquo;s doctors, staff and patients. Despite crippling legislative attacks and an onslaught of anti-abortion extremist harassment, intimidation and violent threats, the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization has kept its doors open. </p>

<p>Just days ago, anti-abortion extremists from across the country – including advocates of justifiable homicide, those that believe in the murder of doctors – targeted the clinic with angry protests. The clinic and its staff stood strong – but they need more security protection. </p>

<p>Take a stand against extremism and help defend the last clinic in Mississippi. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10526">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10526</a> ] Your donation will go directly to the clinic for a new security system. </p>

<p>This clinic is on the frontline in the war on women in the US. Without the courageous staff and doctors who work at the Jackson clinic, Mississippi women would be left with no access to safe legal abortion in the entire state. </p>

<p>Without clinics, there is no choice [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10526">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10526</a> ]. Please help the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization keep its staff and patients safe.
