                    <p>Hey, Feminist Campus Leaders! </p>

<p><br/>
Welcome back to school! For most of you, the 2015-2016 school year has already kicked off – and that means back to books, back to exams, and back to feminist campus activism. As the leader of your group, we wanted to reach out and remind you we are here to support you! The work you are doing on your campus on reproductive rights, ending rape culture and sexual assault, and other social justice activism is so important but is also sometimes challenging. As you gear up for the semester, remember to share the wealth of responsibilities with other E-Board members and connect with supportive faculty. You are doing such a great job! Here are some tips to help you get the semester started off with a bang: </p>

<p>*Restock on feminist swag!* To make your job easier, let us know if you would like some feminist swag! We have three varieties of buttons and stickers – &ldquo;This is what a feminist looks like!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Feminists are the majority!&rdquo; and &ldquo;ERA Yes&rdquo; – as well as tabling materials. Examples of tabling materials can be found on our website here [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/">http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/</a> ]. A starter box includes 25 of each button as well as a sampling of buttons and tabling materials. Email us [ mailto:campusteam@feminist.org ] today with requests for resources! </p>

<p>*Get Out Her Vote! [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/gohv/">http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/gohv/</a> ]** *This November Louisiana, Mississippi, and Kentucky will hold gubernatorial, statewide executive and state legislature elections while New Jersey and Virginia will hold state legislative elections. There will also be tons of local elections all over the country. Student voting is essential, even in non-presidential election years; this is our future being decided. Ultimately, it takes leaders like you to mobilize voters on campus. Check out our Get Out Her Vote Campaign, which gives you the tools, strategies, and resources to get students at your college out to the polls. If you&rsquo;re interested in tackling voter engagement this semester, please let us know and don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact the team for questions, guidance, and advice. </p>

<p>*Follow us on Social Media! *A great way to stay connected to feminist news, actions, and resources from us is to follow Feminist Campus on Facebook [ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/feministcampus">https://www.facebook.com/feministcampus</a> ], Twitter [ <a href="https://twitter.com/feministcampus">https://twitter.com/feministcampus</a> ], Instagram [ <a href="https://instagram.com/feministcampus/">https://instagram.com/feministcampus/</a> ], and Tumblr [ <a href="http://feministcampus.tumblr.com/">http://feministcampus.tumblr.com/</a> ]! Last week we highlighted some of your awesome starts to the semester on Instagram. Check it out!** </p>

<p>*Contact us! *We would love to hear from you! Email the Campus Team [ mailto:campusteam@feminist.org ] to tell us about the your plans are for the semester so we can support you and your team of feminist activists. </p>

<p>Be on the lookout for more information and actions. We have big plans to travel this semester! Let us know if you want a national campus organizer to plan a trip to your university! </p>

<p>Have a wonderful semester! </p>
