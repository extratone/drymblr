<p>Hello, Dry! </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost Feminist Pride Day! Saturday is going to be a day of feminist reclamation, declaration, and inspiration - but why stop at one day? We&rsquo;re partying all week long [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/feministprideday/">http://feministcampus.org/feministprideday/</a> ] - and you&rsquo;re totally invited! There&rsquo;s two ways to jump on board: you can tweet selfies as part of our week-long selfie storm, or you can sign the Feminist Pride Day Pledge.</p>



<p>We want to show the world what feminism looks like - so start by taking a picture of yourself! Whether you&rsquo;re with friends and family or you use a glamorous solo shot, *post a selfie on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag to show the world that you&rsquo;re proud to be a feminist! *(When you post your feminist selfie, you&rsquo;ll also be entered to win some feminist swag from the FMF&rsquo;s Feminist Store [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org">http://store.feminist.org</a> ], and we&rsquo;ll be retweeting and featuring your selfies all week long!) Once you&rsquo;re done showing your beautiful face to the world, *head over to our Feminist Pride Day portal and sign a pledge to declare that you &ldquo;are &rdquo; [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/feministprideday/">http://feministcampus.org/feministprideday/</a> ].*</p>

<p>In honor of Feminist Pride Day, let your feminist flag fly. Now let&rsquo;s get this party started!</p>

<p>Looking forward, <br/>
*The Feminist Campus Team*<br/>
Adriana, Brooke, Carmen, Edwith, Kristy, Maddie and duVergne </p>
