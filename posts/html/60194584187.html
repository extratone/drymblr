<p>Eve&rsquo;s Update From City of Joy: &ldquo;The women will rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=ZKFeoepPAQtLBBYkMgOLEw">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=ZKFeoepPAQtLBBYkMgOLEw</a></p>

<p>V-Day Founder/Artistic Director Eve Ensler was in Bukavu, Democratic<br/>
Republic of Congo (DRC) in August. Here she shares with an update on<br/>
City of Joy (<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=pQ0Y3y-XdW2zv03fvE2xKQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=pQ0Y3y-XdW2zv03fvE2xKQ</a> ) and the new V-World Farm, and brings to<br/>
you the voices of some of the incredible women who are RISING and <br/>
turning their pain to power.</p>

<p>The red dust swallows everything, coats the roofs and goats and faces<br/>
of dazed children who lean out on Essence Road. The dust which begs<br/>
for water where there is no water, for shelter where there are no<br/>
windows or doors. The dust that is spread in wild disregard as fancy<br/>
UN jeeps overtake broken cars leaving bent women balancing<br/>
backbreaking sacks choking in their wake. The dust that erases and the<br/>
dust that turns Bukavu into some post-apocalyptic dream that only rain<br/>
or peace or care will wake.  Mama C says she prefers the mud. Mud she<br/>
says is fresh, alive, wet and everything is green then.</p>

<p>I arrive at City of Joy and the children greet me outside the gates.<br/>
They are decked in pink crown hats made of cardboard and staples. They<br/>
are wearing matching blue and pink pagnes with swirly designs and they<br/>
are jumping and hugging and spinning. The carnival begins, this<br/>
medicinal festival of healing and care that is the City of Joy. This<br/>
place where trauma is so thick and widespread it is a kind of<br/>
contagion.</p>

<p>This place where love is so available and electric, it is an ample<br/>
cure. Here our rising girls, 89 of them dance and sing, their faces<br/>
marked with scars and sorrow and anger and joy and newly donated<br/>
makeup. 89 girls from all over the Congo chosen because of their past<br/>
and pain, chosen for their hunger for a future, not just for<br/>
themselves, but the others. City of Joy, where despite the dry season<br/>
the pink roses are 5 feet tall and the bougainvillea is now thick over<br/>
the archways. City of Joy where bunnies can&rsquo;t stop making<br/>
bunnies and cats have moved in to keep out the mice, where the storage<br/>
room is full of sneakers and medicine and crayons and flashlights and<br/>
towels. City of Joy, where 89 girls arrive  some explosive, some mute,<br/>
some unable to lift their heads, some ready to die. And in just 3<br/>
months, they dance with a thunderous joy, defying everything that has<br/>
been done to them and everything they have been made to believe they<br/>
are. City of Joy, where our Cherie Mamas (social workers) know every<br/>
name, every story, every illness and every dream.</p>

<p>Where Mama Bachu builds their political vision and knowledge of their<br/>
rights and resistance and our new nurse, Marcelline, rocks some to<br/>
sleep. City of Joy, where Prince teaches them how to how to find the<br/>
world on the internet and Dr. Mukwege teaches them to find their their<br/>
vaginas and love them and demand respect. City of Joy, where in any<br/>
given day one woman finally tells her story and is freed and another<br/>
decides she is beautiful. City of Joy, where Mama C builds her<br/>
professional brigade, day by day, lesson by lesson. Where she is loved<br/>
and respected because she has allowed and invited and insisted that<br/>
everyone rise to their best and now they are respected everywhere.<br/>
Every single child of every person who works at the City of Joy<br/>
succeeded in school this year. Each day there is transformation and<br/>
each day the trauma releases and rises like smoke through a chimney of<br/>
hearts.</p>
