                    <p>Hey Feminist Activists!</p>

<p>Are you ready to fired up and ready to get out to the polls on November 3rd! We have been working with students across the country to help get people registered, organize student vote initiatives and turn out the vote on your campuses all fall, and we are coming down the home stretch! This election is important for everyone, but is going to be especially important for Mississippi, Louisiana and Virginia. We have the power to influence the change we need, and it starts at the polls!</p>

<p>Some things to remember before this election begins:</p>

<p>·         Make sure you know where your polling place is:</p>

<p>In some states, you can find your polling place on your voter registration card or it will be sent to you in the mail. You can also search for your polling place on your local board of elections website.</p>

<p>·         Make sure you bring the proper documentation:</p>

<p>Voter suppression of students is mounting across the nation, especially in the south (and we&rsquo;re not gonna take it!). To make sure you can exercise your rights, bring photo ID, a driver&rsquo;s license, and proof that you are registered to vote. Be sure to report any sign of voting abuse to the poll workers to help keep the vote safe for everyone.</p>

<p>·         Organize ridesharing to the polls:</p>

<p>Make sure you and your fellow feminists can get to the polls and beat the ridiculous lines! Ridesharing is a fun way to build community and increase the turnout without hurting the environment. Ask some friends with cars to help you in your efforts! Check out any efforts on your campus to get students to the polls or partner with other organizations on campus to increase your voting power!</p>

<p>Make sure you share your photos with the hashtagly engaged you are! Let&rsquo;s go take on the polls!</p>

<p>In solidarity,                                                                               </p>
