<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>What happens when a mother loses custody to the state?</p>

<p><br/>
Thanks to rigid child welfare laws, she may one day never see her kid again. </p>

<p>Family advocates are calling for reform that would introduce more pathways to reunify parents with their children, and *the latest issue of &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo;* [ <a href="http://msmagazine.com/summer2014/index.asp">http://msmagazine.com/summer2014/index.asp</a> ] makes the case for revamped laws that recognize the need for parental presence in a child&rsquo;s life. </p>
