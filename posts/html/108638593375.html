                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>The 42nd anniversary of &ldquo;Roe v. Wade&rdquo; is just a few days away. To honor &ldquo;Roe&rdquo; we need to *take a stand for women&rsquo;s health now [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989</a> ]*. </p>



<p>The US House of Representatives plans to vote on a 20-week extremist abortion ban this Thursday, January 22 – the anniversary of &ldquo;Roe v. Wade&rdquo;. This extremist bill, one that would ban abortion pre-viability, is a direct attack on &ldquo;Roe&rdquo;. A similar ban in Arizona was deemed unconstitutional by a federal appeals court, and the Supreme Court refused to review that decision – letting stand the decision that the 20-week ban is unconstitutional. Congress must stop wasting time and money on unconstitutional measures. </p>

<p>*Sign the petition to tell your representatives in Congress that the majority of Americans support safe, legal abortion. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989</a> ]* </p>

<p></p>

<p>That the Republican-controlled House would – on the anniversary of &ldquo;Roe &quot;– push forward an unconstitutional bill to deny women the right to an abortion is an outrage. </p>



<p>*Here are 2 things you can do to celebrate &quot;Roe&rdquo;:* </p>



<p></p>

<p><br/>
  * *Email your representatives and senators in Congress! [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989</a> ]** [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16989</a> ]* Tell them that you do not support an extreme, unconstitutional 20-week abortion ban. It goes too far.</p>

<p><br/>
  * *Join us at the Supreme Court!* FMF, NOW, and DC NOW will be  at the Supreme Court on Thursday, January 22, to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of&quot; Roe v.
