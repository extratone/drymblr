                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>$200 billion dollars. That&rsquo;s how much money is grossed annually by the fast-food industry off the backs of workers who make as little as $7.25/hour. </p>

<p>But fed-up fast-food workers are now striking nationwide for higher pay, demanding a $15/hour minimum wage. </p>

<p>Our new edition of Ms. [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] features today&rsquo;s Rosie the Riveter, the woman taking your fast-food order and serving up meals &ldquo;with a smile, &rdquo; even though she can barely make ends meets for her family at home. </p>

<p>Trust me: When you read the facts about an industry that primarily employs - and exploits - women, you&rsquo;ll never look at your hamburger the same way. </p>

<p>Get the full story in our newest edition of Ms.! [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] </p>
