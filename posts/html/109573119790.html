                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p>*Early Bird Registration for the 11th Annual National Young Feminist Leadership Conference ends TOMORROW! [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ] * </p>



<p>We couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about this year&rsquo;s NYFLC. On March 21 and 22, we&rsquo;ll convene to cover topics from global women&rsquo;s rights to reproductive justice and go over the basics of campus organizing - and on March 23, we&rsquo;ll go to Capital Hill and tell legislators what matters to us. The conference will feature campus activists, feminist and political leaders, and other public figures. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to take action, get inspired, network with other activists, and even grab some feminist gear or explore the nation&rsquo;s capital! Young feminists from across the country will be at this year&rsquo;s NYFLC, and you won&rsquo;t want to miss out. </p>



<p>Our Early Bird rates are $25 for individuals and $20 per person for groups of five or more people. After Early Bird Registration closes, those rates will go up - so don&rsquo;t hesitate! **Register today. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ]*** *We&rsquo;re also offering spectacular rates on lodging in the conference hotel for attendees at $132/night for a room that sleeps up to four individuals. </p>



<p>We want you – and your whole feminist campus group! – to attend this year&rsquo;s NYFLC, so start your planning now and you can receive funding from your college or university to help you get here!
