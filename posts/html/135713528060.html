                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Before 2015 ends, we want to ask you for a special tax-deductible, year-end contribution to keep &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; on the frontlines reporting, rebelling, and truth-telling. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=13283">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=13283</a> ] </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only with the support of dedicated individuals – like you – that &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; can remain fiercely independent. Remember, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; is sustained by its readers and supporters – not by advertisers. </p>

<p>Because &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t take advertisements from corporate special interests, you never have to worry that we will shy away from telling it like it is. From shocking Supreme Court decisions allowing bosses to decide their women employees&rsquo; birth control, to campus sexual assault, to the War on Women, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; is the leader in reporting our lives. </p>

<p>This next year will be pivotal in the fight for women&rsquo;s full equality. So we can move forward stronger than ever before in 2016, please make a special tax-deductible, year-end contribution to support &ldquo;Ms&rdquo;. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=13283">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=13283</a> ] </p>

<p>With your support &ldquo;Ms&rdquo;. will remain a trusted source of news and analysis, ideas and inspiration for feminists – here and worldwide. We will continue to raise awareness and inspire our audiences to action, resulting in real and permanent change. </p>

<p>Your tax-deductible contribution [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=13283">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=13283</a> ] helps ensure &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; continues to grow, inspire and educate as it renews and empowers each one of us. </p>

<p>Please give as generously as possible at this time of reflection and holiday cheer to help us meet the challenges ahead and make 2016 a year of impact and celebration.
