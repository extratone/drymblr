<p>RISE FOR OUR SISTERS IN NIGERIA</p>

<p>Dear One Billion Rising and V-Day Activists,</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, 234 teenage girls were kidnapped in the Nigerian city<br/>
of Bornu while taking their exams. It is assumed that the girls were<br/>
taken by Boko Haram, a local Islamic extremist group whose name means<br/>
&ldquo;western education is forbidden.&rdquo; It is feared that the girls have<br/>
been sold into marriage to the militants and some have been moved to<br/>
nearby countries of Cameroon and Chad. Long-time V-Day activist and<br/>
One Billion Rising coordinator in Nigeria, Amy Oyekunle, writes to us<br/>
about the horrific situation there - where conflicting information<br/>
about the girls&rsquo; whereabouts and their current status and situation<br/>
has left parents and loved ones devastated. We are asking you, our<br/>
fellow One Billion Rising and V-Day activists to put the girls in your<br/>
thoughts, prayers, and meditations, as well as those of the Nigerian<br/>
women, men, and activists who have been taking and continue to take to<br/>
the streets until the girls are brought back to their families safely.</p>

<p>We are calling on all of our One Billion Rising and V-Day activists to<br/>
stand and rise for justice with our sisters in Nigeria, and to call<br/>
for global solidarity for Nigeria.</p>

<p>Please do the following:</p>

<p>1. SIGN THE PETITION</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=mhk52XZ4DVNdS3kjJyDIUg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=mhk52XZ4DVNdS3kjJyDIUg</a></p>

<p>:<br/>
USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION IN NIGERIA</p>

<p>The focus is to put massive pressure on the government, security<br/>
forces, and the neighboring governments (of Chad and Cameroon) to spur<br/>
them to action - specifically to. It is deplorable<br/>
that this situation has been happening for quite some time now and<br/>
hasn&rsquo;t received the attention it needs to stop the killings,<br/>
abductions, and constant insecurity plaguing women and girls in the<br/>
North and the rest of Nigeria.</p>

<p>3. HOLD A SOLIDARITY DAY OF ACTION ON 5 MAY</p>

<p>The Nigerian government is currently focused on preparing for the<br/>
World Economic Forum (WEF) taking place in Abuja/Lagos from 6 May - 10<br/>
May holding various meetings and activities. While the event was<br/>
welcomed before the kidnappings happened, there is growing anger that<br/>
the WEF has taken priority over the lives and welfare of over 200<br/>
Nigerian citizens. A huge rally is being planned in Lagos on Monday, 5<br/>
May to call for justice for the missing girls, and to use it as an<br/>
opportunity to show that &ldquo;Women and Girls Matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>WE ARE CALLING ON OUR ONE BILLION RISING NETWORKS ALL OVER THE WORLD<br/>
TO STAND OUTSIDE THE NIGERIAN EMBASSIES IN YOUR COUNTRIES TO DEMAND<br/>
JUSTICE AND TO SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH OUR SISTERS IN NIGERIA.</p>

<p>RISE FOR JUSTICE FOR OUR SISTERS IN NIGERIA!</p>

<p>RISE TO DEMAND THEIR RELEASE!</p>
