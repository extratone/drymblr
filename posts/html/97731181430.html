<p>* Vi Hart is a composer and mathematician who explains mathematical concepts with music, or musical concepts with math. Her many delightfully homespun videos cover topics like infinity, copyright law, net neutrality, and more. Her videos can entertain for days, but “Twelve Tones” is one of my faves <http:>.

<p>* LA-based experimental hiphop group Clipping were one of my favorite musical discoveries this year, and their album Midcity <http:> is fresh and fully streaming on bandcamp. Their sonic palette is rooted in noise and their hearts are in hiphop. This is really inventive music. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Trimpin blurs the lines between sculpture and music with his mind-boggling installations. Here <http:> we see a contraption that makes beats by controlling liquids that drip from the ceiling. A full-length documentary on his work can be accessed from that link as well. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
