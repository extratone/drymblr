<p>Happy International Day of the Girl! On this special day where people<br/>
everywhere are recognizing girls&rsquo; rights and the unique<br/>
challenges girls face around the world, we are thrilled to present<br/>
this update from V-Day Managing Director Cecile Lipworth, V-Girls<br/>
Manager Joliz Cedeño, and One Billion Rising for Justice Global<br/>
Coordinator for Southern Africa Barbara Mhangami Ruwende on their<br/>
recent trip to visit our V-Girls in South Africa. Over the past two<br/>
years these Emotional Creatures have been visiting schools, holding<br/>
summits, and taking action against issues affecting their communities.<br/>
They are self proclaimed REFUSERS who provide safe spaces for girls<br/>
and develop sustainable actions by partnering with other groups who<br/>
share their vision for a world without violence against women and<br/>
girls. We celebrate these young girls who are committed to<br/>
revolutionizing the way girls are seen and treated not only in South<br/>
Africa, but around the globe.</p>

<p>South Africa RISING: Justice for All<br/>
by V-Day Managing Director Cecile Lipworth</p>

<p>I love to travel! It excites me to get on a plane and leave one place<br/>
and arrive in another. But never more so than when I am headed back to<br/>
my home country and hometown, Johannesburg, South Africa. And when my<br/>
travel is V-Day related I know I am going to meet extraordinary<br/>
people. The excitement that filled me as I boarded the plane for South<br/>
Africa with Joliz and Barbara was uncontainable. I barely slept on the<br/>
17 hour flight.</p>

<p>Over two weeks we met with activists, survivors, choreographers,<br/>
executives, sex workers, media representatives, youth, men, teachers,<br/>
students, V-Girls and grassroots leaders. In coffee shops,<br/>
restaurants, boardrooms, school rooms, on college campuses and in<br/>
Parliament, we met women and men, young and old, who are ALL<br/>
impassioned, fiercely determined to create change, and hugely<br/>
inspiring. Whether I was discussing plans for an Africa Tour of<br/>
Emotional Creature in 2014, watching our V-Girls in South Africa bond,<br/>
or hearing how justice should be served during One Billion Rising for<br/>
Justice meetings, I was in continuous awe of the the creative programs<br/>
that are happening in South Africa - paradigm changing concepts that<br/>
activists are putting forward.</p>

<p>It was an amazing two weeks, and I am forever thankful to everyone we<br/>
met for welcoming me back home and allowing us to be a part of<br/>
envisioning a new South Africa!</p>

<p>Emotional Creatures Changing South Africa!<br/>
By V-Girls Manager Joliz Cedeño</p>

<p>There is an energy in South Africa unlike any country I&rsquo;ve<br/>
traveled to before. It doesn&rsquo;t come from its bustling city<br/>
landscape, but rather the present and palpable desire for change. Upon<br/>
meeting activists and V-Girls throughout Johannesburg and Cape Town it<br/>
was evident - South Africans are not ones to wait for justice to<br/>
come, they are already taking action.</p>

<p>The Transformative Journey That was South Africa<br/>
By Global Coordinator for Southern Africa Barbara Mhangami Ruwende</p>

<p>I journeyed to Johannesburg South Africa, with Cecile Lipworth,<br/>
Managing Director of V-Day and Joliz Cedeño the V-Girls<br/>
Manager. We were headed to South Africa to meet with activists, media,<br/>
dancers, philanthropists and other parties who were interested in the<br/>
One Billion Rising for JusticeCampaign, a campaign for justice for the<br/>
victims of rape and violence that would culminate in huge gatherings<br/>
of people demonstrating and dancing in various places on February 14,<br/>
2014. We wanted to get a sense of what activists in South Africa saw<br/>
as the key justice issues around which they wanted to build the<br/>
campaign.</p>
