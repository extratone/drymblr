design 15 May 2015</p>

<p>Catherine Johnson and Rebecca Rudolph are partners and co-founders of the multi-disciplinary firm Design, Bitches <http:>. The duo are advocates of an architecture that is accessible to a broader audience &amp; connected to every day life. Inspired by how people adapt to their space and devise creative solutions to informally marry beauty and function, the work is philosophically at the corner of architecture, culture &amp; pop.
