<p>RISE FOR A FAIR WAGE! Join the National Day of Action Tuesday, October<br/>
14 to Support the One Fair Wage</p>

<p>Join Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC-United), Eve Ensler<br/>
and One Billion Rising: Revolution and rise for a fair wage. In<br/>
today&rsquo;s economy, families depend on both men and women to make ends<br/>
meet. Corporations have stacked the deck against us, raking in profits<br/>
while we struggle with increasing costs and jobs that hardly pay the<br/>
bills. Women are at the core of the modern economy, but families can&rsquo;t<br/>
prosper as long as our laws about work and family are stuck in the<br/>
past. Our mothers, sisters, and daughters deserve full and fair<br/>
opportunities to succeed, just like our brothers and sons. It&rsquo;s time<br/>
to update our economy to make it work for women and their families,<br/>
not just for rich corporations. Our families, our economy, and our<br/>
country depend on it.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 14, Join ROC-United, Eve Ensler, and One Billion<br/>
Rising in a National Day of Action for ONE FAIR WAGE</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=vYEF4p5ffQcWqkfoxbArPw">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=vYEF4p5ffQcWqkfoxbArPw</a></p>

<p>and an end to gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the<br/>
restaurant industry.</p>

<p>The action will include a flash mob of dancing servers, worker stories<br/>
from ROC members, and an opportunity for others to share their stories<br/>
and experiences in the industry.</p>

<p>writes to us from One Billion Rising: Revolution launch events in<br/>
Haiti and Nepal:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vaginas In The Haitian Parliament!&rdquo; by Anne-Christine D'adesky, Haiti</p>

<p>Today was a historic day for Haiti and for the groups in the One<br/>
Billion Rising for Revolution movement in and outside Haiti. We hosted<br/>
The Vagina Monologues in Kreyol and French by the talented performance<br/>
group Theatre Atelier Ecolosion, led by Florence Jean-Louis and the<br/>
superstar actors Cynthia Jean-Louis and Ange Bellie Andou -<br/>
great talents and sexy performers - and also Fabienne Colimon,<br/>
et Huguette Saint Fleur. Eve Ensler was the special guest of this<br/>
event hosted by Senators from the Parliament and joined by Deputys. We<br/>
had a packed house, and a very appreciative audience. For many, it was<br/>
the first time they had heard such positive, open discussions of<br/>
women&rsquo;s sexuality and desire, and it was a most welcome one. The men<br/>
of the Parliament warmly embraced the play, the themes and the cause<br/>
of the One Billion Rising Revolution, and have proclaimed themselves<br/>
strong allies ready to do their part.</p>
