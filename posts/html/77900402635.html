                                    <h1>Join Us: Stand Shoulder-To-Shoulder With Afghan Women</h1>
                    <p>Dry,</p>

<p>Afghan women just won a huge victory: the Ministry of Justice amended a controversial provision of the draft Afghan Criminal Procedure Code that would have barred relatives from testifying against each other in criminal proceedings [ <a href="http://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/02/06/afghan-parliament-votes-to-silence-victims-of-violence/">http://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/02/06/afghan-parliament-votes-to-silence-victims-of-violence/</a> ], including in cases of domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual assault. These changes came after the Afghan Women&rsquo;s Network, with over one hundred women-led organizations, came out strongly against the provision. </p>

<p>Although this is a victory for all Afghan women, the real lesson here is about the promise and strength of local Afghan women-led civil society organizations. We see the impact that Afghan women&rsquo;s groups can have, and we know that they are already a strong voice for women&rsquo;s rights, development, democracy, and justice. We must continue to help amplify that voice, so that Afghan women play a central role. </p>

<p>*Take a pledge with us to support Afghan women and Afghan women&rsquo;s organizations [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15161">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=15161</a> ]. *Let them know that we are proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in the fight for women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; equality. </p>

<p>In solidarity, <br/>
