We hope you&rsquo;re enjoying some much-deserved time off from school and are deep into your Netflix queue. (Grace and Frankie, anyone?!) Again, we want to congratulate you on another AWESOME semester. You all rallied, protested, fundraised, demonstrated, lobbied, and educated your campuses and communities about feminism. Now it&rsquo;s your chance to tell us all about it! Every person who fills out our End of Year Survey [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feministsurvey] is entered to win a feminist prize pack! </p>
