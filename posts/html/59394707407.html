                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>During the Texas abortion debates in June, state Sen. Leticia Van De Putte spoke for an entire nation of women with one simple question: </p>

<p>Join Ms. Today [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10267">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10267</a> ] </p>

<p>Sen. Van De Putte, in raising her hand and voice, ignited the galleries and extended Sen. Wendy Davis&rsquo; filibuster until the legislative session expired. The Texas feminists may have lost the short-term battle, but they ignited the nation. We must keep their energy and spirit going until we stop the War on Women. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for all of us to raise our hands, to demand to be heard. Join the Ms. campaign to stand with women in Texas, Ohio, Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, North Dakota, North Carolina, New Jersey and in all the states where mostly-male legislators and governors are cutting back women&rsquo;s access to abortion and family planning. *It must stop.* </p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m asking you to support Ms. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10267">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10267</a> ] in its efforts to rally the nation to win the battle on women&rsquo;s health. Stand with us and take a pledge that you will do all you can to stop the War on Women. To help inspire others to take the pledge, we&rsquo;ll print your name in the next edition of Ms. Women will not go back to the back alleys. We demand access to contraceptives and abortion in all states in the USA. It&rsquo;s a fundamental right. </p>

<p>We need you. Join the feminist army to save women&rsquo;s health. [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10267">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=10267</a> ] </p>

<p>For women&rsquo;s lives, </p>
