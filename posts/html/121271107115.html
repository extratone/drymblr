Seventh Class Graduates from City of Joy -<br/>
CONGRATULATIONS Graduates!</p>

<p>City of Joy Graduation 2015</p>

<p>88 Women &amp; Girls Graduated, On Their Way to Becoming Leaders Of Change<br/>
In DRC</p>

<p>On 4 June, City Of Joy and V-Day Congo hosted an extraordinary<br/>
ceremony for the newest class of graduates. As of today, 580 women<br/>
have come through the program, transformed their pain into power, and<br/>
returned to their communities as seeds of revolution.</p>

<p>The V-Day Congo team wrote a report about the ceremony including<br/>
profiles of three graduates&rsquo; stories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The graduation day was a special day for women who came as survivors<br/>
of gender- based violence in December 2014 but who were happy to go<br/>
back to their communities with fierce, power and capacity to lead and<br/>
change such things as retrograde customs which prevent women from<br/>
having and demanding their rights because they experience violence<br/>
almost every day in their households, schools/colleges, work places,<br/>
churches, etc.</p>

<p>The graduation day was a day in which every woman celebrated herself.<br/>
It was a day to tell how City of Joy is an engine of transformation in<br/>
which they lived for six months to turn into brave, beautiful, and<br/>
strong women leaders. The change  physical, emotional, intellectual,<br/>
etc.  was something the audience noticed in the face and in the life<br/>
of every woman.&rdquo;</p>

Kabul</p>

<p>PWCE Afghanistan</p>

<p>Following is an update from Fariba about their revolutionary<br/>
educational center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On 14 Feb 2014, with V-Day&rsquo;s help, we opened an education<br/>
center for women and young girls in Kabul, which provides free<br/>
English, computer, science, and literacy courses. Also, we organized<br/>
seminars on psychological therapy for women, dealing with common<br/>
issues like anxiety, depression, and suicide. Furthermore there have<br/>
been seminars covering issues like women&rsquo;s rights in society,<br/>
women&rsquo;s legal rights, birth control, and other women&rsquo;s<br/>
health issues&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
