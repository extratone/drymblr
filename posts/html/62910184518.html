<p>We&rsquo;ll be speaking at our luncheon that afternoon as we honor three fearless trailblazing feminists: Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a champion for equal pay for women; Texas state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, a courageous fighter for reproductive rights; and Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyer&rsquo;s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law who is leading the charge for voters&rsquo; rights. </p>

<p>Our General Assembly Sessions throughout the day will focus on stopping the War on Women&rsquo;s health, improving global reproductive family planning policies, ending violence against women and implementing the Affordable Care Act! We&rsquo;ll also discuss new strategies to ratify both CEDAW and the Equal Rights Amendment. </p>
