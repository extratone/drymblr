                    <p>Dear Dry,</p>

<p><br/>
Ahh, springtime! The birds are chirping, the flowers are blooming and the conference circuit is heating up! We are ready to transition in like a lion and out like a lamb to warmer days, longer nights and a sweet springtime filled with feminist activism. Our Feminist Campus Organizers are hitting the conference tour and we want to meet up with your angelic feminist faces!</p>

<p><br/>
Our HBCU and Southern Campus Organizer Chelsea Yarborough and our Midwest Campus Organizer Mari Vangen are headed down South for two (yeah, you read that right - TWO!) conferences in South Carolina and Georgia! The first stop on the trip is to the Southeastern Women&rsquo;s Studies Association Conference [ <a href="http://www.sewsa.net/2016-winthrop/">http://www.sewsa.net/2016-winthrop/</a> ] at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C on March 31st. From South Carolina they&rsquo;ll be headed to Spelman College in Atlanta, GA for the Toni Cade Bambara Conference, [ <a href="http://www.spelman.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/comparative-womens-studies/toni-cade-bambara-conference">http://www.spelman.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/comparative-womens-studies/toni-cade-bambara-conference</a> ] happening April 1st-2nd! </p>

<p><br/>
Catch our Mid Atlantic and Northeastern Campus Organizer Kelli Musick at the Civil Liberties and Public Policy Program&rsquo;s [ <a href="https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference">https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference</a> ] annual conference at Hampshire College in Amhurst, MA, happening April 8th-10th! She&rsquo;ll be tabling in the exhibitor&rsquo;s hall with feminist goodies, ways you can get active on your campus, and her trademark fiery red mane, of course. </p>

<p><br/>
Drop us a line at campusteam@feminist.org if you&rsquo;ll be in the area for these conferences - we&rsquo;d love to see you!</p>

<p><br/>
In solidarity, </p>

<p><br/>
Your Feminist Campus Organizers </p>

<p>Chelsea, Edwith, Mari, and Kelli</p>
