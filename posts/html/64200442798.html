<p>An Evening with Dr. Denis Mukwege &amp; Eve Ensler is part of the<br/>
RISE4JUSTICE Speakers Series which will examine the meaning of justice<br/>
to activists working globally to end gender violence and oppression,<br/>
while looking at impunity caused by the intersection of poverty,<br/>
racism, war, the plunder of the environment, capitalism, imperialism,<br/>
and patriarchy. The series is presented by V-Day, the global activist<br/>
movement to end violence against women and girls, and ABC Carpet &amp;<br/>
Home.</p>

<p>Dr. Mukwege is the Director and Founder of the ground-breaking Panzi<br/>
General Referral Hospital in Bukavu, South Kivu, Democratic Republic<br/>
of the Congo, where he performs life-saving fistula surgeries on girls<br/>
and women who have been brutally raped and mutilated in the Congolese<br/>
war. He is also the head of the Panzi Foundation, which runs the City<br/>
of Joy, and the Godfather of the V-Men movement.</p>

<p>*100% of the proceeds will go to the Panzi Foundation, supporting the<br/>
ongoing work of Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, DRC and creating new<br/>
outreach projects to rural clinics and communities.</p>

<p>RISE4JUSTICE: Malalai Joya:<br/>
