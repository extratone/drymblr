<p>Dear V-Friends &amp; Risers,</p>

<p>2015 was a revolutionary, evolutionary year for V-Day and One Billion<br/>
Rising. Your solidarity and support made it possible!<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=lVksUNteccZX6rzuGmYaLg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=lVksUNteccZX6rzuGmYaLg</a></p>

<p>Activists worldwide called for system change towards ending violence<br/>
against women and girls. They staged plays, risings and events, rose<br/>
in the streets, changing laws, consciousness and culture with an<br/>
impact that is breathtaking and powerful.</p>

<p>It is our honor to share the 2015 Annual Report. These pages are a<br/>
snapshot of those global activities and an invitation to join us in<br/>
2016.</p>

<p>This year, our V-Day campaigns expanded the dialogue around sexual<br/>
violence as activists raised funds and awareness through performances<br/>
of The Vagina Monologues and A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant and A<br/>
Prayer from a prison in upstate New York to a theater in Tehran. The<br/>
plays catalyzed important conversations and inspired new works of art.</p>

<p>City of Joy and V-World Farm continue to blossom and grow in the<br/>
Democratic Republic of Congo, transforming pain to power amidst<br/>
ongoing conflict in the region. The farm is going even deeper,<br/>
transforming pain into planting, healing the body and the earth.</p>

<p>In its third year, One Billion Rising called for Revolution, to<br/>
escalate tectonic global change. It was stunning to see how the call<br/>
resonated around the world. Never have we seen such diversity -<br/>
children, men, older people, LGTBQI, religious leaders, people of all<br/>
abilities, farmers, workers, NGOs, presidents and prime ministers.<br/>
Never have we seen such creativity; the movement continues to been led<br/>
by art, theater, music, dancing, poetry, drumming because that is<br/>
where revolution is activated.</p>

<p>The report is available in an interactive online format.<br/>
