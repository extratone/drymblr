                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>I may be more than 1,500 miles away from Texas, but I want all of our pro-choice supporters to know something: </p>

<p>I will not stop fighting with you. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8201">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8201</a> ] </p>

<p>At 3:30 p.m. today (4:30 ET), our allies in Texas will head back to the State Capitol for another hearing on abortion restrictions and testify on how detrimental this legislation really is. </p>

<p>Dry, if you&rsquo;re like me and are far away from the action, you can still help [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8201">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8201</a> ]. We need to show both our friends in Texas and the GOP legislators that this fight is far from over. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what you can do: <br/>
  * Sign our email [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8178">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8178</a> ] to show Gov. Rick Perry how you feel about the special session and these abortion restrictions <br/>
  * Sign our thank you card [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8201">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=8201</a> ] to state Sen. Wendy Davis and keep cheering her pro-choice supporters on <br/>
  * Tweet about the Texas session using the hashtags, and </p>

<p><br/>
Texas is far from the only state pushing legislation like this - it already happened in Virginia. And just this weekend, Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a budget that includes provisions to close most of the state clinics. </p>

<p>We won&rsquo;t stop in Ohio. We won&rsquo;t stop in Virginia. We won&rsquo;t stop in Texas. As long as legislators keep waging these attacks on reproductive rights, we&rsquo;ll be there fighting back. We will protect women&rsquo;s health clinics. </p>

<p>For equality, </p>
