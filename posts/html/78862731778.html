<p>As International Women&rsquo;s Day, 8 March, begins, we are excited to share<br/>
this special note from our ONE BILLION RISING FOR JUSTICE Global<br/>
Coordinators and highlights from this year&rsquo;s campaign.</p>

<p>Risings are still happening throughout Canada and across the globe,<br/>
please be sure to CHECK OUT our event map<br/>

<p>to find one near you.</p>

<p>We would like to say a huge, collective THANK YOU to activists and<br/>
groups around the world for the incredible risings that took place on<br/>
and around 14 February 2014, and for the risings taking place<br/>
throughout Canada and the world tomorrow on International Women&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<p>We thank everyone for going deeper into the justice issues in each<br/>
community, city, and country, for coming together to address impunity,<br/>
for gathering and dancing together to show our collective strength and<br/>
energy in our demand to end violence against women and girls. We thank<br/>
you for your amazing creativity, artistry, energy, courage, and<br/>
determination.</p>

<p>As global coordinators, we are in awe of the work that you did to<br/>
deepen the campaign in your communities, and humbled by the broad and<br/>
committed engagement. Through your work we saw multiple sectors coming<br/>
together to demand justice, and we saw coalitions being formed and led<br/>
by grassroots activists who have been doing the work of ending<br/>
violence for years. We thank you for affirming what a global<br/>
solidarity movement truly means - people coming together for a<br/>
uniquely local, yet shared global vision of a world where women can<br/>
one day live with equality, freedom, respect, and dignity.</p>

<p>We encourage activists all over the world to keep Rising for Justice<br/>
until the violence stops!</p>

grassroots women&rsquo;s movement consider to be the main perpetrators of<br/>
the continued state instigated violence: the Philippine government led<br/>
by the Philippine President Aquino&hellip;&rdquo; more &gt;</p>
