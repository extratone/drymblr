<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Thank you for your support of FMF as we enter our 26th year. Together we won some amazing victories. But we have much more to do. </p>

<p>Please consider making a special contribution today. [ <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9734">https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9734</a> ] </p>

<p>FMF&rsquo;S National Clinic Access Project is protecting independent abortion clinics and women&rsquo;s health centers against domestic terrorism. Already in 2013, we have sent our legal coordinator and senior organizers to Mississippi and Kansas to provide security assistance, brief law enforcement, and mobilize community support for clinics who are beseiged by extremists. </p>

<p>FMF&rsquo;s Choices Campus Leadership Program, the largest of it&rsquo;s kind in the nation, has been key in defeating three extreme anti-reproductive state ballot measures in Mississippi (Nov., 2011); in North Dakota (June, 2012); and in Florida (Nov. 2012). Right now we are launching our new State Capitols Campaign at our National Campus Conference, which will have over 500 students from some 130 campus groups. We are determined to turn the tide at the state level. </p>

<p>Campaign for Afghan Women and Girls: Since 1997, our Campaign has worked to stop gender apartheid and to help Afghan women and girls. </p>

<p>Wherever the Taliban has power, feminist leaders and non-profit humanitarian workers have been assassinated and schools have been closed. We cannot allow Afghan women and girls to be forgotten. </p>

<p>Right now, our high school and middle school program, Girls Learn International (GLI), has the largest girls delegation (50 students) at the UN Commission on the Status of Women. We are participating in programs to end violence against girls. We now have over 100 GLI chapters in 22 states. </p>

<p>Never have our challenges – and opportunities – been greater. We are determined that extremists here or abroad will not take away the dream of equality for women and girls. </p>

<p>Please consider contributing today.

Together, we are making, and will, make a difference. </p>

<p>For Women&rsquo;s Equality, </p>

<p>Ellie Smeal<br/>
Feminist Majority Foundation President </p>
