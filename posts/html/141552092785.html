<p>COJ update March 2016 1.JPG</p>

<p>Greetings from Bukavu My Dear Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>I write in the middle of a glorious downpour.</p>

<p>It will be five years in June since we opened City of Joy. Between the<br/>
insecurity, lack of roads, little electricity, mad rain, costs of<br/>
building, the vision of our Congolese sisters could easily not have<br/>
been realized. So first, this is a huge thank you to all of you who<br/>
believed in the vision and who have stayed with us on this miraculous<br/>
journey.</p>

<p>On June 23, at our next graduation, 759 women will have graduated City<br/>
of Joy. 759 women will have been healed, nurtured, educated, fed,<br/>
empowered joined into a community and network of love and revolution.<br/>
759 women will have released massive trauma and horrific memories. 759<br/>
women will have danced, sung, learned their rights, performed plays,<br/>
developed agricultural skills, come to love their bodies. 759 women<br/>
will be leaders in their communities, no longer stigmatized for being<br/>
raped but instead forces of energy and determination, entrepreneurs of<br/>
small business, initiators of collectives, restaurants owners, farmers<br/>
with new land, educators and advocates on sexual violence, volunteers<br/>
in a self-created recruiting network for new women at COJ,<br/>
journalists, immigration workers, tailors, students,<br/>
herbalists&hellip;Continue Reading </p>
