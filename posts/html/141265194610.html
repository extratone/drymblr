                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>*We want to hear from you! [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/white-house-summit-on-women-and-girls-thoughts/">http://feministcampus.org/white-house-summit-on-women-and-girls-thoughts/</a> ]** [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/white-house-summit-on-women-and-girls-thoughts/">http://feministcampus.org/white-house-summit-on-women-and-girls-thoughts/</a> ]** * </p>

<p>At this year&rsquo;s NYFLC Town Hall, we heard from Tina Tchen, Assistant to President Obama and Executive Director of the White House Council on Women and Girls, and Kathleen Biden from Civic Nation, and had the opportunity to share ideas for the upcoming United State of Women Summit, sponsored by the White House. The Summit will celebrate all we&rsquo;ve achieved and how we&rsquo;re going to take action moving forward. </p>

<p>Tina and Kathleen want to make sure they hear everyone&rsquo;s voices while they plan the Summit - *and they&rsquo;re planning the agenda now*! What do you want to hear about? Who do you want to hear from? </p>
