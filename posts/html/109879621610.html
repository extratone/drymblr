<p>* We fell in love with Hunger Crunch <http:> because it’s so cool-looking and really addicting to play, but then once you know that it actually goes toward helping real kids with real problems it becomes the greatest game on the planet. 100% of any purchases made in the app provide much needed food to awesome kids.

<p>* We’re a little family project and love seeing other things families are creating together. Olive Us <http:> is a really cool web series made by a family of six kids. Each video is totally different, but always great and always fun. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Salemtown Board Co. builds handmade skateboards <http:> and was created by some dudes who wanted to give Nashville, TN kids a reason to dance. They employ, train, and mentor at-risk teenagers. Their story is awesome. Their boards are awesome. Everything they’re doing is awesome. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
