<p>Activists Reflect On The Tenth Anniversary Of The Storm </p>

<p>Ten years after the devastating storm hit New Orleans and the Gulf<br/>
South, the city of New Orleans and surrounding communities still face<br/>
a deluge of obstacles in their efforts to rebuild their neighborhoods<br/>
in an equitable and authentic way.</p>

<p>The women of New Orleans and the Gulf South have survived the fall out<br/>
of global warming, failure of public structures, racism, economic<br/>
hardship, and violence against women. All of these are pieces of the<br/>
story of violence that continues to impact women here in this country<br/>
and around the world. </p>

<p>One decade out, we bear witness to the rebirth of this culturally rich<br/>
city and the surrounding wetlands being led by incredible activists<br/>
with a deep understanding of her historical context. </p>

<p>Carol Bebelle- Letter From The Frontlines Of Katrina Recovery</p>

<p>Carol Bebelle</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am looking for the things I am for, and how to create them.<br/>
I am working to be informed, but not constrained, by numbers.</p>

<p>I am trying to keep my head, when all around me<br/>
are blaming it on others.</p>

<p>I am trying to be an encourager for us to activate our own personal<br/>
power, and watch it do its thing<br/>
as it connects to others creating this magnificent WE!<br/>
I am trying to be about beauty.</p>

<p> In New Orleans we are rising and resisting everywhere.&quot; </p>

<p>In honor of the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Carol<br/>
Bebelle, Co-Founder and Executive Director of the Ashé<br/>
Cultural Arts Center, native New Orleanian &amp; longtime V-Day<br/>
activist wrote a letter about the ongoing recovery efforts in the city<br/>
and the need for art in activism in the face of mounting obstacles.<br/>

<p>Swimming Upstream</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=t2UQqER0HuKBWh_nt85zxA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=t2UQqER0HuKBWh_nt85zxA</a></p>

<p>Written by 16 New Orleans&rsquo; women, Swimming Upstream premiered in 2008<br/>
at V-Day&rsquo;s &quot;V To The Tenth&rdquo; celebration and enjoyed subsequent<br/>
performances in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Houston, New Orleans, NYC, and<br/>
Santa Fe. Swimming Upstream is a powerful theatrical production that<br/>
tells the raw and soulful stories of women who lived through the flood<br/>
with grace, rage and great resiliency, punctuated by a flair for story<br/>
telling, humor and music that comes from being New Orleanian.</p>

<p>This video is from the premiere of the play at the Superdome in April,<br/>
2008.</p>
