GLOBAL ACTIVISTS DEMAND THE RELEASE OF OUR SISTERS IN CHINA</p>

<p>One Billion Rising activists around the world continue to demand the<br/>
release of our activist feminist sisters from China  Li Tingting,<br/>
Zheng Churan, Wei Tingting, Wang Man and Wu Rongrung  who were<br/>
arrested for their work to create awareness and education on violence<br/>
against women and girls issues.</p>

<p>This is an update from an activist sister on the ground:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The women are still in criminal detention. In China the maximum<br/>
duration is thirty days. During this period, police and people from<br/>
the security department will fetch the detainees for interrogation at<br/>
intervals, and question them about some specific activities they have<br/>
planned and organized before. This is for collective evidence, for a<br/>
formal arrest and prosecution. According to the lawyers, the detention<br/>
itself is not within due process of the law. The cause for detaining<br/>
them is &quot;creating disturbances&rdquo;, but they (we) had not<br/>
even implemented their (our) action plans before the detention. And<br/>
all the similar activities we had done before did not break any single<br/>
article of Chinese law. All the five girls are full time grassroots<br/>
NGO staff. One of the organisations they work for is the main target<br/>
of this crackdown and whose office was broken into and searched, and<br/>
where all their archives were carried off on March 25th, which again<br/>
happened at midnight.</p>

<p>The girls are basically well personally but we haven&rsquo;t had any<br/>
more information about Zheng Churan for two weeks now because her<br/>
lawyer suddenly left China for another case. The new lawyer is coming<br/>
to take his place. Policemen have continued to disturb the volunteers<br/>
nationwide who participated in the former activities and are forcing<br/>
then to give evidence (evidence for no crime). Some important<br/>
activists working in sister organizations are now going into exile and<br/>
are leaving China. They are not afraid of being arrested but they<br/>
don&rsquo;t want to give &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to help police frame<br/>
the five women. But all the support internationally does help.&ldquo;</p>

<p>One Billion Rising activists from all over the world continue to<br/>
condemn the detaining of our five young activist feminist sisters from<br/>
China, who now face prosecution no later than April 8th under illegal<br/>
and inhumane procedures, and are demanding their immediate release.</p>

<p>We call on China to uphold the outcomes of the Beijing Declaration and<br/>
Platform of Action, which was created in China at the historic<br/>
international conference in 1995. As hosts of the conference, they,<br/>
beyond all doubt and measure, are ethically mandated to deliver on the<br/>
promises and commitment to advance women&rsquo;s rights- including<br/>
women&rsquo;s political and human rights, and the basic liberties of<br/>
self, social and political expressions. They are ethically bound to<br/>
adhere to the agreements made at the summit twenty years ago. It is<br/>
such an expression of hypocrisy to purport to advocate for<br/>
women&rsquo;s rights when they have exerted repressive, inhumane and<br/>
illegal measures towards Li Tingting, Zheng Churan, Wei Tingting, Wang<br/>
Man and Wu Rongrung.</p>

<p>We demand their immediate and unconditional release!</p>

<p>We demand that the Chinese government stop the brutal political<br/>
repression of their women&rsquo;s human rights defenders!</p>

<p>We call on everyone to make their voices heard for justice for these<br/>
women, and protest outside the Chinese embassies around the world<br/>
before, leading up to and on April 8th  the day they are likely to be<br/>
prosecuted. We ask activists and all members of civil society to<br/>
demand their release, to keep up the pressure, and to highlight in<br/>
their local and national media the real situation and expose the<br/>
Chinese government for being repressive, brutal and hypocritical, and<br/>
who do not respect human rights and national agreements that bind them<br/>
to the world as a global nation.</p>

<p>We stand in solidarity alongside our sisters in China. We RISE against<br/>
the political repression they are experiencing and the violation of<br/>
their human rights. As a global community, we RISE for Justice for<br/>
them  and we collectively show our indignation at the suppression and<br/>
curtailment of the rights of women human rights defenders who have<br/>
committed their lives to ending all forms of violence against women<br/>
and girls. They are the future of China. We must keep RISING to ensure<br/>
their futures are not taken away from them.</p>
