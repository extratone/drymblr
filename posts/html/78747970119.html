Dry,</p>

<p>Women all over the world will celebrate International Women&rsquo;s Day on Saturday, March 8, by taking action for their social, political, and economic equality. The United Nations&rsquo; official IWD theme for this year is &ldquo;equality for women is progress for all,&rdquo; and we couldn&rsquo;t agree more! This International Women&rsquo;s Day, celebrate with us by speaking out for women&rsquo;s rights â€“ eight times.</p>
