                                    <h1>Early Bird Rates Are Still Available for NYFLC!</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>*Early Bird Registration is still open for the 11th Annual National Young Feminist Leadership Conference [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2015-nyflc/">http://feministcampus.org/conferences/2015-nyflc/</a> ]! *Young feminists from across the country will be at this year&rsquo;s NYFLC from March 21 to 23, and you won&rsquo;t want to miss out on as we cover topics from global women&rsquo;s rights to reproductive justice in panel discussions and go over the basics of campus organizing in our workshops. Our events will feature campus activists, feminist and political leaders, and other public figures. You&rsquo;ll have the chance to take action, get inspired, network with other activists, and even grab some feminist gear or explore the nation&rsquo;s capital! </p>

<p>*Our Early Bird rates are $25 for individuals and $20 per person for groups of five or more people. After Early Bird Registration closes, those rates will go up - so don&rsquo;t hesitate! * [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ] [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ]* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ]*Register today [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82727</a> ].*** *We&rsquo;re also offering prizes to the largest delegations in attendance and the largest Early Bird Registration groups, so go ahead and register a friend as well! We&rsquo;re also offering spectacular rates on lodging in the conference hotel for attendees at $132/night for a room that sleeps up to four individuals. </p>

<p>We want you – and your whole feminist campus group! – to attend, so start your planning now and you can receive funding from your college or university to help you get here! Questions?

<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing a diverse array of feminists at the conference this year, and we hope you&rsquo;ll join us in celebrating more than a decade of young feminist action and leadership across the nation. </p>
