                    <p>VSL // Baseball And Manifest Destiny</p>

<p>* Obsessive fans like Batting Stance Guy <http:> inspired me to keep going while I was working on my new Fantasy Life series, despite not being a baseball fan myself. He’s got the least marketable skill in America and he’s famous for it <http:>-– which is very American. [1 of 3]</http:></http:></p>

<p>Tabitha Soren <http:> is an artist outside fo San Francisco, who currently has an exhibit about baseball and Manifest Destiny up at Kopeikin Gallery in Los Angeles.

<p>* Star Walk <http:>, a simple astronomy app that harnesses the GPS in your phone and tells you exactly what’s going on over your head in the sky, gave me lots of ideas for arranging the bone spurs my players donated to the exhibit. I wanted their sacrifice to look like stars against a night sky in the show. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* At the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie <http:> in Milan, an UNESCO world heritage site, you can see “The Last Supper” by Da Vinci. It’s a much more meditative place than most of Milan and I thought back to it often when working on The Modesto Nuts Bullpen image Fantasy Life. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
