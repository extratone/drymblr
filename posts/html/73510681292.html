 Online Learning @ New York School of Interior Design<br/>
 REGISTER TODAY FOR THE SPRING SESSION<br/>
 Introduction to Interior Design | Historical Styles | Textiles for Interiors  |  Color for Interiors<br/>
 Our distance learning offerings are flexible and convenient, and were designed  for the working professional or busy student who cannot attend classes on our  NYC campus. NYSID instructors teach every course and the curriculum and  learning goals are the same as the on-site courses, but reformatted to  encourage participation and connection. Each course is asynchronous, meaning  that you do not have to “log in” at a set time. Instead, students watch recorded  lectures and demonstrations, participate in discussions, access handouts and  assignments, and communicate with the instructor and fellow students.</p>
