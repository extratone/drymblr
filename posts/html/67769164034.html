<p>THANK YOU V-Day Activists FOR HELPING THE PHILIPPINES<br/>
Together, We&rsquo;ve Raised $203,655 So Far!</p>

<p>In a little over a week, you, our incredible V-Activists, have raised<br/>
over $203,655 for the V-Fund for the Philippines<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=8tpSEZbjWFFYkwN08x7RsA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=8tpSEZbjWFFYkwN08x7RsA</a></p>

<p>. Your donations are already making an impact, with the first caravan<br/>
of relief goods including food, sanitary napkins, underwear, diapers,<br/>
baby formula, and medicines currently on their way to 20,000 families.<br/>
Below is an update from One Billion Rising Director Monique Wilson, as<br/>
well as a letter from our partners on the ground, GABRIELA and<br/>
Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party. We wanted to share this with all of you. All<br/>
your generosity and support helped make this possible.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Lingap Gabriela, BALSA Starts Yolanda/Haiyan Mission Trek for<br/>
Eastern Visayas, Philippines</p>

<p>Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party Rep. Emmi De Jesus yesterday joined the BALSA<br/>
multi-sectoral disaster aid caravan that left Manila on November 21st<br/>
on a rough road trip to deliver at least a dozen trucks loaded with<br/>
relief packs, hope and solidarity to communities in the Eastern<br/>
Visayas waylaid by the super typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan.</p>

<p>The women&rsquo;s rights solon heads the LINGAP (&ldquo;aid&rdquo;) GABRIELA team,<br/>
composed of 30 urban poor leaders and women health care workers who<br/>
toiled the past few nights in bundling up &ldquo;Mother and Child Relief<br/>
Packs&rdquo; containing underwear, sanitary napkins and VAW (Violence<br/>
Against Women) educational flyers, aside from over 20,000 family packs<br/>
with standard relief items containing food provisions for 3 days. The<br/>
fliers, written in Tagalog and Waray languages, provided instructions<br/>
for women to defend themselves from gender violence in situations<br/>
where they are vulnerable.</p>

<p>De Jesus added that she wants to zero in on the reported incidences of<br/>
violence against women and children and the rising risks to human<br/>
trafficking especially in the totally devastated areas of Samar and<br/>
Leyte where poverty translates into lawlessness and criminality. &ldquo;The<br/>
Gabriela center for women&rsquo;s services is not only wrecked. Our staff<br/>
went to Tacloban and surrounding towns last week and reported they<br/>
lost their hospitals, clinics, and schools, which makes women so<br/>
vulnerable and all the more without access to health services,&rdquo; De<br/>
Jesus explained.</p>

<p>To help the public follow their progress, the organizers put up the<br/>
Twitter hashtag<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=J0lD-dR829YtSO6zDWvfLA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=J0lD-dR829YtSO6zDWvfLA</a></p>

<p>where they post pictures and stories of updates, as well as action<br/>
bulletins for donors and volunteers.</p>

matched) &gt;<br/>

<p>Letter From GABRIELA &amp; Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party</p>

<p>Dear V-Day and One Billion Rising sisters and brothers,</p>

<p>In behalf of the women and children of the typhoon-affected provinces<br/>
of the Philippines, we thank you for your kind help and donations.</p>

<p>Lingap Gabriela and our relief partner, Bayanihan Alay sa Sambayanan<br/>
(BALSA) is set to leave tomorrow for the national relief mission to<br/>
Eastern Visayas.</p>

<p>Along with 20,000 family relief packs containing food provisions for 3<br/>
days, we will also be distributing mother and child relief packs to<br/>
help ease the suffering and particularly address the urgent needs of<br/>
women and children affected by Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan.</p>

<p>The Lingap Gabriela delegation will also be looking into the condition<br/>
of women and children especially amid reports of rape and violence<br/>
against women and children in the area. Psycho-social first aid<br/>
sessions will also be conducted to help victims, especially children,<br/>
cope with the trauma.</p>

<p>We are gearing up for more relief and service missions in the coming<br/>
weeks to address the needs of other areas affected by the typhoon.</p>

<p>Once more, our heartfelt gratitude.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Joms Salvador<br/>
Secretary General, GABRIELA Alliance of Filipino Women</p>

<p>Lana Linaban<br/>
Secretary General, Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party</p>

<p>One Billion Rising For Justice Philippines - UPCOMING EVENTS!</p>

<p>Upcoming One Billion Rising for Justice events in the Philippines<br/>

<p>*  THE STATE OF FEMALE JUSTICE IN THE PHILIPPINES</p>

<p>As part of the launch of One Billion Rising for Justice<br/>
Philippines, Gabriela, Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party and the New Voice<br/>
Company will be presenting THE STATE OF FEMALE JUSTICE IN THE<br/>
PHILIPPINES with the theme - &ldquo;WOMEN RISING AFTER<br/>
DESTRUCTION.&rdquo; After a natural and man-made disaster, communities<br/>
face hunger, illness, displacement, trauma and death, but women<br/>
and children face particular risks from sexual violence and<br/>
trafficking. The event will explore the deeper causes and<br/>
consequences of environmental and social injustice, and the<br/>
specific impact on women, and will also highlight how our<br/>
incredible community women are re-building, organizing and<br/>
Rising after the destruction of typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. At the<br/>
end of the panel there will be a sharing of the report from our<br/>
Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Mission/Caravan to the devastated areas. The<br/>
event will culminate with a memorial/solidarity OBR action for<br/>
the survivors and victims of the storm, led by the Gabriela<br/>
community women.</p>

<p>*  &ldquo;RISE FOR JUSTICE&rdquo; AT THE PHILIPPINE CONGRESS</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise for Justice&rdquo; Exhibit - a photo exhibit that will highlight<br/>
the cases of violence against women in children (VAWC) and the<br/>
actions taken by the different municipalities to fight violence<br/>
against women.  Support will be gathered from Legislators and<br/>
Local Government officials to address VAW through concrete<br/>
programs at the national and local level. The event, which will<br/>
take place at the North Wing Lobby of the Philippine House of<br/>
Congress, is an initiative of Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party, the House<br/>
of Representatives Committee on Women and Gender Equality and<br/>
the Association of Women Legislators Foundation, Inc.  It is in<br/>
commemoration of November 25: National Consciousness Day for the<br/>
Elimination of Violence Against Women and Children and will<br/>
