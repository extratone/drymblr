<p>&ldquo;No one believed my father was a battering sex abuser. He was<br/>
handsome, a corporate president. He was successful, charming, a<br/>
man&rsquo;s man. He wore tailored suits. He played golf. He drank<br/>
martinis. He was celebrated at country clubs and knew the first names<br/>
of head maitre d&rsquo;s at the fanciest exclusive restaurants. He was<br/>
arrogant and smug the way Bill Cosby is arrogant and smug. He had an<br/>
air of superiority and contempt for those who he perceived to be weak<br/>
or incapable of rising the way he had risen. He set himself up as the<br/>
chief moral arbiter of right and wrong in the same way that Cosby<br/>
asserted himself as public moralist on issues of family values and<br/>
crime. He was righteous, particularly about honesty. He was obsessed<br/>
with honesty. There were many times when he would beat my head against<br/>
a wall or whip me with belts for lies he imagined I had told or would<br/>
one day possibly tell. I never understood why he was so angry. I think<br/>
I do now. He was raging because he was caught between two competing,<br/>
demanding personas, one public, one private. He was raging because his<br/>
whole life was one big seething contaminating lie. A lie that was<br/>
supported and nurtured by the power that men have over women, adoring<br/>
and terrified colleagues, and my dependent mother. A lie that got him<br/>
countless free passes, second chances, and cheeks turned.</p>

<p>Like my father, Bill Cosby was allegedly one thing in public, Dr.<br/>
Huxtable, and another in the dark or behind closed<br/>
doors&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

center for women and young girls in Kabul, which provides free<br/>
English, computer, science, and literacy courses. Also, we organized<br/>
seminars on psychological therapy for women, dealing with common<br/>
