                                    <h1>Your Discount Code to Screen The Hunting Ground!</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>For a limited time, Feminist Majority Foundation supporters like you get a *50% discount* to screen The Hunting Ground, a brand new documentary that focuses on the epidemic of rape crimes on college campuses across the United States. </p>



<p>How can you screen The Hunting Ground? </p>

<p>1. Pick a date, venue, and time for your screenings and apply to host your screenings through this formal application form, here: <a href="https://filmsprout.formstack.com/forms/campus">https://filmsprout.formstack.com/forms/campus</a> [ <a href="https://filmsprout.formstack.com/forms/campus">https://filmsprout.formstack.com/forms/campus</a> ]. This form is one-stop shopping for both seeking approval for a campus event &ldquo;and&rdquo; for paying the screening fee. </p>

<p>2. All screenings will be approved unless there is already a campus event in place on campus, in which case you will be asked to reschedule your event after the existing event, or to join forces with the group that&rsquo;s already hosting a screening. Conflicts or overlaps like these are not very common, but they do happen, and particularly on special months like Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), when many groups are activating around the issue! Be sure to scan the campus listings at <a href="http://www.thehuntinggroundfilm.com/screenings">http://www.thehuntinggroundfilm.com/screenings</a> [ <a href="http://www.thehuntinggroundfilm.com/screenings">http://www.thehuntinggroundfilm.com/screenings</a> ] to be sure your campus isn&rsquo;t already on the list. Of course, we know some campuses are big enough to support many events&ndash;say, one at the law school and another for undergraduates. If you feel your audience is different than that of another existing campus event, feel free to apply, even if an event already exists on campus. </p>

<p>4. The usual fee to screen the film is $400 plus shipping. With the Feminist Majority Foundation discount code, the fee will be $200 plus shipping. *All applicants should use the code **FM50SAAM*, which must be used *before May 1*, to receive the discount. Applicants should enter this code in the &ldquo;Promotion Code&rdquo; box, and click &ldquo;apply.&rdquo; The discount will be reflected in the subtotal field. </p>



<p>If you need assistance, you can always email campus@filmsprout.org [ mailto:campus@filmsprout.org ] and campusteam@feminist.org [ mailto:campusteam@feminist.org ]. </p>
