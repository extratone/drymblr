<p>Eve&rsquo;s Tour Concludes, Thank You Activists!</p>

<p>Eve&rsquo;s 19-city North American Tour for her newest book In The Body of<br/>
The World has come to a close and we could not be more grateful to all<br/>
of you, our incredible activists who came out, asked questions, shared<br/>
stories, danced, and inspired us in so many ways. The tour was a huge<br/>
success, raising awareness and funds for V-Day&rsquo;s work to end violence<br/>
against women and girls, and that&rsquo;s all because you came out and<br/>
supported! THANK YOU!</p>

<p>We would also like to give a special shout out to some incredible<br/>
people in cities across the U.S. and Canada who helped make the tour<br/>
possible by hosting events and raising funds for V-Day&rsquo;s work,<br/>
including: Susie Tompkins Buell; Kathleen Fontaine &amp; Debbie<br/>
Fleischaker; Joan Baker &amp; Margeaux Klein; Cecile Lipworth; Heather<br/>
Moseley; Belinda Munoz; Nikki Noto; Wendy Schmidt; Laura Seydel;<br/>
Sharon &amp; Howard Socol; and V-Board members Carole Black, Pat Mitchell,<br/>
Emily Scott Pottruck, Amy Rao, Regina Kulik Scully, Sheryl Sandberg,<br/>
Lisa Schejola Akin, and Susan Celia Swan.</p>

<p>Events Raise Funds To End Violence Against Women and Girls</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks there have been some very special events<br/>
taking place that have raised funds for V-Day&rsquo;s work. We are honored<br/>
to be working with such incredible people around the globe:</p>

<p>V-Board Member Thandie Newton Hosts Jimmy Choo Party in Support of<br/>
V-Day</p>

<p>On May 22, V-Board member Thandie Newton co-hosted a party for the<br/>
launch of Jimmy Choo&rsquo;s pre-fall collection. The private event,<br/>
which took place at Clifton Nurseries in London, brought the issue of<br/>
violence against women and girls, and V-Day&rsquo;s efforts worldwide<br/>
to end the violence, to a new and excited audience, and raised funds<br/>
for V-Day&rsquo;s work on the ground.</p>

<p>Women of Congo Represented On Top of The World</p>

<p>In 2008, activist climber Georgina Miranda founded the Climb Take<br/>
Action&amp;;7 Summits Challenge, a campaign dedicated to empowering women<br/>
in Democratic Republic of Congo by climbing to raise awareness about<br/>
the sexual violence in DRC, and funds to support their healing. To<br/>
date she has reached 6 of the 7 summits, and most recently on May<br/>
21st, Georgina reached the ultimate pinnacle, the Summit of Mount<br/>
Everest.<br/>

<p>Georgina has dedicated herself to this challenge for five years and in<br/>
that time has raised over $33,000 for the women of Congo, with funds<br/>
split between V-Day&rsquo;s work in the region, and International<br/>
Medical Corps. We could not be more proud of Georgina, and we<br/>
recommend you all check out her blog at climbtakeaction.com<br/>
