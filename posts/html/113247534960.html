                                    <h1>URGENT: Afghan Girls Need Our Help NOW</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Some 18 years ago, the Feminist Majority began what many thought was a hopeless fight to end a brutal system of gender apartheid in Afghanistan. Despite the odds, I am proud that, together with you, we spoke up and led a successful fight to stop the U.S. and the UN from recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate government. *Right now, we need your help again. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000</a> ]* </p>

<p>* [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000</a> ]* [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000</a> ] </p>

<p>We knew then and we know now we must not ignore a regime or ideology that takes every human right away from women. Hundreds of thousands of supporters signed petitions and letters and over two hundred women&rsquo;s organizations and groups joined us to take action. And we made a difference.</p>

<p><br/>
*Now it is time to speak up again. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000</a> ]* You see, some Americans want the U.S. to leave Afghanistan - to pull the last 10,000 support troops who are helping the new Afghan unity government, the Afghan army, and the police to provide security in the face of the terrorist tactics of current Taliban forces and new threats from ISIS. </p>

<p><br/>
Many Afghan women leaders as well as ordinary Afghans are saying their number one concern is security, and they want the remaining U.S. support troops to stay. We support the Afghan women&rsquo;s groups concerns. This is no time to leave Afghanistan completely when women and girls are making progress and the new unity government, pledged to women&rsquo;s empowerment, is trying to move forward. The new leaders have signed a bilateral 10-year agreement with the U.S. Why provide aid without providing some security at this critical time? </p>

<p><br/>
*Please urge President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and Congress to provide not only aid but also security during this transformative moment of change and hope. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11000</a> ]*</p>

<p><br/>
President Obama is right now reviewing his decision to withdraw 5,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2015 and ALL troops by the end of 2016. Afghan women and girls have come too far to be turned back now. If the Taliban returns, too many of the women who have gone to work and school and who have taken on leadership in government or in the several hundred established Afghan women&rsquo;s groups, will be killed. We must stand shoulder-to-shoulder with these courageous women. </p>
