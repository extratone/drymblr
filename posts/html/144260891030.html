                    <p>Hi there Dry! </p>

<p>While you&rsquo;re marathoning the latest Game of Thrones season, your Campus Team is hard at work preparing for an awesome feminist summer and fall semester! (No worries, y'all â€“ this email doesn&rsquo;t contain any Jon Snow spoilers.) We want to make sure to keep you and your club in the loop [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16]! </p>

<p>Unlike the Iron Throne, club leaders have graduated peacefully and the 2016-2017 Executive Boards have taken their place. This survey lets us know who these new, fabulous activists are and how we can stay in touch as we ramp up for another fantastic year. </p>

<p>Take our survey so we can learn more about your activism and the activists leading the fight! [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16]</p>

<p>Jam out to Lemonade and tell us about all of your highlights from this past year like your best meeting topic, favorite campaign, or coolest fundraiser. The feedback you give us in the End of Year Survey [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16] ensures we&rsquo;re doing all that we can to support y'all! </p>

<p>The Seven Kingdoms would want you to be proud of your accomplishments - take our End of Year Survey [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16] and tell us about your year of activism!</p>
