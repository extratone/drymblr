                    <p>Dry, </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going live today! And we want you to come along for the ride. </p>

<p>*Join the East Coast Feminist Campus Team on YouTube at 4PM EST *to talk plans for this semester (and what we learned last semester), inclusivity and coalition work, recruitment and sustainability, and what to expect at this year&rsquo;s NYFLC - all from the comfort of home! (Or work. Or the bus. Or anywhere!) All you need to be a part of is an Internet connection. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: at 4PM EST, you can go straight to our live YouTube broadcast [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHz8zN2-h4M] to watch Edwith, Kristy, and Maddie talk with some of their student leaders about what&rsquo;s going down on their campuses and what we&rsquo;re doing here at Feminist Campus. *While you&rsquo;re watching, you can tweet questions and comments using; we&rsquo;ll answer you on Twitter @feministcampus or in our recap blog post after the broadcast is done!* If you can&rsquo;t make it, don&rsquo;t worry - the video will remain on our channel for eons and eons once the broadcast is over, and you can still ask us questions at campusteam@feminist.org anytime. All feminist activists are welcome to participate - not just campus activists or FMLA leaders - and we really hope you stop in! </p>

<p>For this edition of, our organizers will be joined by Ronnie W. (President of the University of Toledo Feminist Alliance), Suhaira C. and Attanya D. (President and VP of Stony Brooke University FMLA), and Priyanka K. (President of Feminists in Action at Emory University). You don&rsquo;t wanna miss it, and we&rsquo;re super excited to see you there! </p>

<p>Tweet you later, </p>
