<p>Join us for the &ldquo;Ms. &quot;Wonder Awards Luncheon [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82464">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=82464</a> ] at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on November 19, 2014 to celebrate our 42nd Anniversary. We&rsquo;re proud to announce that we will be honoring grassroots activists fighting to raise the minimum wage and student activists fighting to end sexual assault on campus.* *</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also be celebrating with Ms. founding Editor *Gloria Steinem*, executive editor *Katherine Spillar*, FMF chair *Peg Yorkin*, co-chairs of the Anniversay Event *Alix Ritchie* and *Elizabeth Hemmerdinger*, dozens of co-sponsors including *National Organization for Women*, *National Congress of Black Women*, *Planned Parenthood*, *American Association of University Women*, *Americans United for Separation of Church and State*, *Catholics for Choice*, *National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association*, *National Network to End Domestic Violence*, *NARAL Pro-Choice America*, and over 400 feminist leaders and activists. </p>
