<p>will ensure that on 14 February 2014, ONE BILLION RISING FOR JUSTICE<br/>
will bring the need for accountability and the end of impunity to the<br/>
table.</p>

<p>As activists in 128 countries escalate their efforts and plan local<br/>
One Billion Rising For Justice 2014 events, our core team continues to<br/>
create path breaking resources, toolkits, &amp; short films; connect<br/>
networks; and use social media to activate and engage the dialogue of<br/>
justice.</p>

<p>*  Peru is Rising for the hundreds of thousands of indigenous women<br/>
who were sterilized during the Fujimori regime and for the tens<br/>
of thousands of women who were raped during the armed conflict<br/>
and have never received justice.<br/>
*  Farmworkers in the US and Mexico are Rising for immigration<br/>
reform, farmworker women&rsquo;s rights and an end to sexual<br/>
harassment in the workplace.<br/>
*  South Africa is Rising to end &lsquo;corrective rape&rsquo; against<br/>
lesbians.<br/>
*  Guatemala is Rising in support of laws to protect women and to<br/>
highlight indigenous women and their vision of justice.<br/>
*  Bangladesh is Rising to lobby political parties to bring<br/>
legislation to protect women.<br/>
*  Los Angeles is Rising to promote rape awareness and sexual<br/>
assault in the military, engaging courts, local police and<br/>
sheriff departments.<br/>
*  Haiti is Rising to bring a State of Female Justice to Haiti as<br/>
defined by Haitian survivors and women&rsquo;s groups.<br/>
*  The Philippines is Rising against militarization, corporate<br/>
greed, mining, economic injustice and labor exploitation, and<br/>
the plundering done by a corrupt government that severely<br/>
impacts women and girls.<br/>
*  Mexico City, Atlanta, Miami and San Francisco are Rising to Stop<br/>
Sex Trafficking.<br/>
*  College students in the US are Rising to stop sexual assault on<br/>
campuses and to hold administrations accountable to properly<br/>
prevent or adequately respond to the needs of college survivors.</p>
