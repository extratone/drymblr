<p>*Support the *&ldquo;Ms. &quot;Magazine Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MP14email">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MP14email</a> ]* </p>

<p>Dear Dry,</p>

<p><br/>
Did you know that about 70 percent of the women in prison have been convicted of nonviolent crimes? That the majority have dependent children? And many are serving for the crimes of their significant others?</p>



<p></p>

<p>Women in domestic violence shelters are also extremely isolated. And they, too, often lack libraries of reading material. </p>



<p>We at &quot;Ms.&rdquo; magazine decided reporting about women in prisons and domestic violence shelters was not enough. We want to let them know they are still valued and that we are in touch. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why we started the *&ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; Magazine Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program*-to provide free copies of &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; to women in prisons and shelters. </p>



<p>*We&rsquo;re asking &ldquo;Ms. &quot;supporters to be a part of the program by making a contribution for a friend they don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;.&ldquo; [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MP14email">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MP14email</a> ]* </p>



<p>Let women on the inside know we&rsquo;re not forgetting them. Let women in shelters know that it&rsquo;s unfair for them to be deprived of home, for their own safety, while the criminal is free. </p>



<p>*Please make a tax-deductible contribution to the &quot;Ms.&rdquo; Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program today.* [ <a href="https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MP14email">https://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=12741&amp;oqd-sourcecode=MP14email</a> ]</p>



<p><br/>
Offer to women on the inside the support, facts, creativity, humor and feeling of community that the women&rsquo;s movement has brought to us on the outside. </p>



<p>With Friendship, <br/>
Gloria Steinem<br/>
