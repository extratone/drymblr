<p>Throughout the month of February and leading up to International<br/>
Women&rsquo;s Day (8 March), and continuing throughout the year, activists<br/>
RISE to end the violence against women and girls that 1 in 3 women<br/>
face. That&rsquo;s ONE BILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw communities across the globe dancing their One Billion Rising<br/>
Dance for Revolution - in creative defiance against violence,<br/>
injustice, inequality, marginalization and oppression. And their<br/>
bodies dancing together in communities - connected across the world in<br/>
this global movement that is using art as a glorious, fierce and<br/>
unshakable force of resistance - is a strong and powerful call to<br/>
overhaul and change our current systems of violence and greed&rdquo; stated<br/>
Eve Ensler, One Billion Rising Founder &amp; Monique Wilson, One<br/>
Billion Rising Global Director</p>

<p>One Billion Rising: Rise for Revolution 2016 is an escalation of the<br/>
first three stages of the campaign. This year, activists radicalized<br/>
their actions - enlarging, deepening and expanding the Revolution. We<br/>
continued to radically shift consciousness and by being braver,<br/>
bolder, more creative and determined with our actions. Activists and<br/>
organizers focused on the most marginalized women and girls in their<br/>
communities, and applied the 2016 call to action &ldquo;Listen! Act! Rise!&rdquo;<br/>
to their local context to bring about true, long lasting change.</p>

<p>Using dance as a form of protest - as a tactic of revolutionary<br/>
self-love and artistic expression, the world was witness to events,<br/>
rallies, flash mobs, artistic uprisings, panel discussions, and<br/>
concerts taking place in locations where women felt safe or deserve to<br/>
feel safe.</p>

<p>This is what it looked like. The photo essay is<br/>
available on The Huffington Post &amp;</p>

<p>India RISING! Read the National Rising Report</p>

<p>India&rsquo;s Official National Newsletter Issue</p>

<p>A<br/>
Message From The National Secretariat: For the fourth consecutive<br/>
year, India rose to another height, the madness prevailed and it is<br/>
still not over!</p>

<p>The OBR rising month- February 2016, has created a new chapter in<br/>
the herstory of the OBR risings. For us it is the<br/>
multi-dimensional, pluralistic, inclusive and above all young- yes it<br/>
has come to age, it is in its fourth year. The first time in 2013 when<br/>
we threw a small pebble into the pond of creativity &amp; solidarity,<br/>
with dancing steps of activism, protest and power of collective<br/>
risings, little did we realise one day it will turn into the largest<br/>
global mobilisation&hellip;</p>
