                                    <h1>Save Women's Lives - Join the Thunderclap</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>*Join us as we call on President Obama* [ <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/19746-us-abortion-policy-hurts-women">https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/19746-us-abortion-policy-hurts-women</a> ] to take executive action to ensure that women and girls all over the world have access to life-saving abortion care.</p>

<p>Each year, an estimated 47,000 women will die from unsafe abortion. Nearly 800 women around the world die in pregnancy and childbirth every day – 287,000 women a year, mostly in the developing world – and millions more suffer from injury, infection, or disease during pregnancy and childbirth. </p>

<p>*Tell President Obama to act now to help save lives and alleviate the suffering of women worldwide* [ <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/19746-us-abortion-policy-hurts-women">https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/19746-us-abortion-policy-hurts-women</a> ]. For over 40 years, the Helms Amendment to U.S. foreign assistance has been misapplied to block access to safe abortion care for women – even in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment. President Obama can correct that.</p>

<p>The Helms Amendment prevents U.S. foreign assistance for abortion &ldquo;as a method of family planning&rdquo; - but it &ldquo;allows&rdquo; U.S. funds to help women who are survivors of rape or incest, and for those with life endangering pregnancies, to access safe abortion care.</p>

<p>*We are joining with many other organizations* [ <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/19746-us-abortion-policy-hurts-women">https://www.thunderclap.it/en/projects/19746-us-abortion-policy-hurts-women</a> ] to call on President Obama to stand with women and girls in the developing world. Join the Thunderclap – a way to amplify your voice on social media. The bigger the Thunderclap, the more likely it is we can change policy to allow lifesaving abortion. </p>
