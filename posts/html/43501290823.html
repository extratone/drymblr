<p>U.S. Activists! Use the momentum of One Billion Rising To Get VAWA<br/>
Passed!</p>

<p>February 14th might be over but ONE BILLION RISING has only begun! Now<br/>
is the time to harness the power of your activism to change the world.<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=UvzyZAIYk9Jaact17RA6qA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=UvzyZAIYk9Jaact17RA6qA</a></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by getting the Senate version of VAWA to the House floor<br/>
for a vote!</p>

<p>We are calling on all of our U.S based activists to RISE for VAWA and<br/>
we have a simple 2 week plan, with the aim to get VAWA passed by<br/>
International Women&rsquo;s Day on March 8th.</p>

<p>THIS Week:</p>

<p>Organize an event in your communities!  Your representatives are<br/>
currently at home and they need to see the support and feel the<br/>
pressure of their constituents.  You can do this event anywhere and<br/>
the event can be anything:</p>



<p>*  You&rsquo;ve already got your dancing shoes on so hold a RISE for VAWA<br/>
flash mob!<br/>
*  Hold a rally in a public space (town square, local mall, town<br/>
hall etc) and invite local activists to speak about the<br/>
importance of VAWA and ending violence against women and girls<br/>
*  Protest outside of government offices and buildings<br/>
*  Hold a concert, open mic night, theatrical production, etc to<br/>
support VAWA and those working to get it passed</p>



<p>Any of these options and more will help highlight the support for VAWA<br/>
in your community.</p>

<p>NEXT Week:</p>

<p>Starting on Monday February 25th,Â your representatives will be<br/>
back in Washington D.C. We are urging you ALL to flood their telephone<br/>
lines and email inboxes with messages of support for VAWA. MAKE YOUR<br/>
VOICE HEARD!</p>
