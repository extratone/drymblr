<p>Hey Dry!  </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re super excited to invite you to be a part of the 2014 Youth ShowOUT [ <a href="http://youthshowout.org/">http://youthshowout.org/</a> ], a collaborative campaign between Feminist Campus, Advocates for Youth, and Planned Parenthood Generation! The campaign will engage and mobilize young voters like you across the country in dialogue and action around various issues – and we&rsquo;re counting on you to bring it home! </p>



<p></p>

<p>Midterm elections are right around the corner, and there&rsquo;s a lot at stake. It&rsquo;s more important than ever that feminists educate and mobilize their peers around issues like reproductive rights, marriage equality, and voter suppression in order to make sure young people, women, and people of color are heard this November at the ballot box.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why young people need to do more than just turn out to vote this year. They need to ShowOUT - by educating their friends, registering voters, participating in voter pledge drives, volunteering and more. We want to ensure that young people across the country - regardless of their positions or partisan leanings - become part of the political process and seize their power.</p>



<p></p>

<p>So, what can you do? A bunch! As November creeps closer, we&rsquo;ll keep you posted on different ways to be a part of this movement, but you can start now by… <br/>

  * Brush up on your ballot measures! The elections in Tennessee, Colorado, and North Dakota, to name a few big ones, will be deciding some HUGE ballot measures impacting a woman&rsquo;s right to control her own body and make her own reproductive decisions.
