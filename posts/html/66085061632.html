<p>As you&rsquo;re aware, threats to abortion access and family planning aren&rsquo;t just coming from extremists. There are major threats at the state and city levels. If you&rsquo;re in VA, there&rsquo;s a very important gubernatorial election TODAY [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/im-a-registered-virginia-feminist-celebrating-national-voter-registration-day-by-taking-action/">http://feministcampus.org/im-a-registered-virginia-feminist-celebrating-national-voter-registration-day-by-taking-action/</a> ].
