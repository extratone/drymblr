<p>* Pair chocolate and childhood memories of pop rocks-style exploding candy with a more sophisticated taste of sea salt and a dash of chipotle and you have the best dessert and party favor I’ve eaten all year <http:>. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Imagine eating Nobu while rocking out to the Foo Fighters. I work on things I believe in, and Life is Beautiful <http:>, a festival that takes place in the under the radar, revitalized Downtown Las Vegas area, is one of those magical experiences, putting just as much emphasis on chefs and food as it does its musical headliners.
