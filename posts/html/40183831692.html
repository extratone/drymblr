Dear Dry, <br/>
Abortion Providers are Heroes [ <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608">https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608</a> ] </p>

<p><br/>
As we celebrate Roe v. Wade&rsquo;s 40th Anniversary, we are painfully aware of the increasing threats to reproductive rights. We must keep our nation&rsquo;s clinics safe and open. </p>

<p>Support work to defend clinics in honor of Roe&rsquo;s anniversary today. [ <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608">https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608</a> ] </p>

<p>The Feminist Majority Foundation&rsquo;s National Clinic Access Project, the oldest and largest in the country, has worked with besieged clinics for 25 years to counter the constant attacks and threats. *Right now, FMF is sending organizers to work with clinic health care workers in Wichita, Kansas, and in Jackson, Mississippi.* </p>

<p>In Wichita, where Dr. George Tiller was brutally murdered almost four years ago, a group of courageous medical professionals are working to re-open Dr. Tiller&rsquo;s clinic. Our law enforcement experts and organizers are traveling to Wichita to provide critically needed assistance. We must make sure that what happened to Dr. Tiller never happens again. </p>

<p>The only abortion provider in Mississippi, the Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization – long the target of extremists – has never stopped providing its critical services. Operation Save America/Operation Rescue is traveling from North Carolina to Mississippi to target the clinic from January 19th-22nd. We are sending FMF campus organizers to assist with community organizing and clinic defense. What&rsquo;s more, the state has passed a TRAP law in an effort to close this clinic. </p>

<p>Please help the Feminist Majority Foundation do organizing and security work to help these embattled healthcare workers and doctors. [ <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608">https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608</a> ] With your help, we are assisting the clinics in Wichita and Jackson and many more across the country. </p>

<p>Please make a tax-deductible contribution to day to support FMF&rsquo;s National Clinic Access Project [ <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608">https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=9608</a> ] as we defend clinics on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Without clinics, there is no choice. </p>
