<p>this week&rsquo;s discovery:<br/>
Hugo Guinness for J.Crew </p>

<p>Introducing the multitalented Mr. Guinness: illustrator, writer, actor (fun fact: He voiced a role in the Wes Anderson film Fantastic Mr. Fox). But British-born Hugo Guinness is probably best known for the quirky and collectible black-and-white prints he creates in his Brooklyn studio. So after he appeared in the pages of our catalog a few years back (yes, he&rsquo;s also a sometime model), we couldn&rsquo;t resist asking him to bring his witty artwork to the walls of our NYC stores. This spring, Guinness adds sweater designer to his repertoire with a new, exclusive-to-us collaboration. The artist picked a few favorites from his archives, including this English bull terrier with a &ldquo;magnificent, strange-looking&rdquo; appearance. His prints were then intarsia-knit into our Italian cashmere and hand embroidered for a textured finish. &ldquo;I really like seeing my work used for different things in different ways,&rdquo; Guinness says. How fantastic is that? </p>
