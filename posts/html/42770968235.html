<p>We&rsquo;re At the Precipice of a New World<br/>
YOUR PLEDGE is Needed To Take The Leap</p>

<p>We are only days away from One Billion Rising and couldn&rsquo;t be more<br/>
excited! There are now 200 countries signed up to participate in this<br/>
world wide event, along with world leaders, celebrities,<br/>
organizations, and activists who are ready to Strike, dance, RISE,<br/>
proving that everyone is ready to say enough and end violence against<br/>
women for good.</p>

<p>One Billion Rising is the beginning of the new world ignited by a new<br/>
energy. It is not the end of our struggle but the escalation of it,<br/>
and while we are all ready to shake the earth with our dancing on 14<br/>
February, we are asking everyone to make One Billion Rising more than<br/>
just a single day of action. </p>

<p>By taking the One Billion Rising Pledge, and asking EVERYONE at your<br/>
event to do the same, you are helping to finish what we have all<br/>
started by making ending violence against women and girls THE central<br/>
issue locally, nationally, and internationally. The world is ready to<br/>
shift and it begins with you.  The One Billion revolution has<br/>
started and with your pledge it will continue to grow.<br/>
