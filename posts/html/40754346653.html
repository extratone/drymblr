<p>4 Weeks From Today the RISING Will Begin!</p>

<p>We are 4 weeks away from the very first RISINGS! As the day rises in<br/>
the east and continues across the Pacific Islands, Asia, Europe,<br/>
Africa, and the Americas, a billion will RISE and DANCE to end<br/>
violence against women and girls!<br/>

<p>Are you ready for your event on 14 February 2013?</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to help you plan:</p>

<p>READ Eve Ensler&rsquo;s Newest Monologue &ldquo;Rising&rdquo;: Eve has just written a<br/>
new piece which she composed during her recent travels in India,<br/>
amidst the incredible uprising there.  We envision this monologue as a<br/>
beautiful addition to your event to motivate the participants to<br/>
dance.<br/>

<p>MAKE The One Billion Rising Pledge: One Billion Rising is the<br/>
beginning of the new world ignited by a new energy. It is not the end<br/>
of our struggle but the escalation of it. We are suggesting that<br/>
everyone who rises makes a pledge to do one thing in the next year to<br/>
end violence against women. Spread the word at your event and have all<br/>
of your participants make the pledge! We believe a billion people will<br/>
rise. Imagine a billion activated pledges.<br/>

<p>ORGANIZE A &ldquo;Break The Chain&rdquo; Flash Mob: &ldquo;Break The Chain,&rdquo; the One<br/>

sequence that you can learn with your fellow RISERS right from home!</p>

<p>WEAR Red &amp; Black: We&rsquo;re encouraging all RISERS to wear red and black<br/>
in solidarity with our fellow One Billion Rising activists throughout<br/>
the world, and those women and girls who could not be here to STRIKE,<br/>
DANCE, and RISE with us.</p>

<p>A Moment of Solidarity: Choose a time during the day to take a moment,<br/>
join together with your colleagues, fellow students, family members,<br/>
and friends, and leave your workplaces, schools, and homes and be<br/>
together as one.  With the earth beneath you raise your hand in the<br/>
air if you can for one minute. Stop everything, look around, and know<br/>
you are a part of a worldwide movement of 1 billion people standing<br/>
together in solidarity to end violence against women and girls.</p>
