                    <p>VSL // Design By Hand</p>

<p>* As designers, we are constantly asked by clients to provide photo realistic 3-D renderings of our projects, but our personal preference is more for hand drawn illustrations. London-based illustrator Thibaud Herem <http:> is one of our favorites. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* I am a closet tumblrfile. i fucking wish <http:> is a constant source of inspiration. The tag line says it all: “At the end of the day when I&rsquo;m in bed I curse myself and tell myself I fucking wish I made that.” [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Although the trendy Venice street Abbot Kinney has become a bit overrun with chain stores as of late, there are still a few independent boutiques left on the block. Tortoise General Store <http:>, with its more private gallery Tortoise <http:> tucked away behind it, are two of the best. [3 of 3]</http:></http:></p>
