<p>FFL President&rsquo;s Report</p>

<p>Serrin M. Foster</p>

<p>MISSION DRIVE</p>

<p>Feminists for Life of America recognizes that abortion is a reflection that</p>

<p>our society has failed to meet the needs of women.</p>

<p>We are dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women</p>

<p>to abortion-primarily lack of practical resources and support-through</p>

<p>holistic, woman-centered solutions.</p>

<p>Women deserve better than abortion.</p>

<p>The following are highlights of our recent work for women and children,</p>

<p>made possible by the sacrifice of our dedicated members and generous donors.</p>

<p>ADVOCACY and LEGISLATIVE EDUCATION</p>

<p>Educating Federal and State Legislators&ndash;and the Future Leaders:</p>

<p>Thanks to a very special donor for leadinga challenge match, FFL has been able to<br/>
provide lawmakers, their staffs, and student activists with &ldquo;Pro-Woman Answers to<br/>
Pro-Choice Questions,TM&rdquo; including talking points and a &ldquo;Birthmothers Deserve Better&rdquo;<br/>
article, as well as our</p>

<p>recently updated &ldquo;Voices of Our Feminist Foremothers,&rdquo; &ldquo;You Have</p>

<p>Better Choices,&rdquo; and our basic philosophical brochure. To date, FFL</p>

<p>has distributed 14,000 kits across the country!</p>

<p>Protecting Pregnant and Parenting Rape Victims from Rapists who Seek Visitation</p>

<p>At the invitation of Vermont Right to Life Committee, Serrin presented her landmark<br/>
speech, &ldquo;The Feminist Case Against Abortion&rdquo; at the Vermont State House for the <br/>
Roe v.Wade Anniversary.. During her address, Serrin advocated for legislation to<br/>
 protect rape survivors (both mother and child) from rapists who seek custody or<br/>
 visitation.</p>

<p>Serrin, FFL Vice President Sally Winn, and FFL speaker and rape survivor Joyce McCauley-Benner<br/>
provided feedback to various state level organizations working on similar legislation.</p>

<p>Twenty years after a coalition meeting to pass the Violence Against Women Act, when<br/>
Serrin first addressed the need to legally protect mothers and children conceived<br/>
during sexual assault from rapists seeking visitation and custody, half of the states<br/>
have enacted such laws.</p>

<p>FFL celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act and the 35th<br/>
anniversary of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</p>

<p>College Outreach Program</p>

<p>Serrin presented &ldquo;The Feminist Case AgainstAbortion&rdquo; across the country and often<br/>
to full houses, some standing room only. Stops on her tour included the University<br/>
of Vermont, Providence College(RI), TulaneUniversity(LA), George Mason University(VA),<br/>
the 2nd annual YaleUniversity pro-life conference Vita Et Veritas, Seattle University<br/>
(WA),Clarion University (PA), and  the University of Chicago (IL), (which has a <br/>
section of their webpage devoted to abortion).</p>

<p>A year after her first lectures at Wofford University and Converse College in Spartanburg,<br/>
SC, Serrin returned to moderate the first ever back-to-back FFL Pregnancy Resource<br/>
Forums. Each panel, comprised of professors from both schools, arrived at joint <br/>
solutions for students on both campuses.</p>

<p>Pepperdine&rsquo;s Dean of Student Affairs reported they now have scholarships to house<br/>
mothers and their children! (Serrin moderated an FFL Pregnancy Resource Forum there<br/>
years ago, and efforts continue!)</p>

<p>Serrin also moderated the 19th Annual Pregnancy ResourceForum at Georgetown University.</p>

<p>Sally presented &ldquo;Refuse to Choose: Reclaiming Feminism&rdquo; at Carroll College (MT),<br/>
 the University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the University<br/>
of Minnesota at St. Paul, the University of Wisconsin at Platteville, Georgia Tech,<br/>
and Williams College (MA). Sally addressed leaders at Students for Life of America&rsquo;s<br/>
National Conference and the first SFL West Coast Conference-and she&rsquo;s invited back<br/>
this January!</p>

<p>Sally moderated the first-ever FFL Pregnancy Resource Forum at Wooster, and another<br/>
at St. Louis University, where, inspired by a previous FFL speaker, a child care<br/>
 fund was established years ago.Sally also led the second FFL Pregnancy Resource<br/>
 Forum at Boston University, a year after Serrin led the first.</p>

<p>Sally also revisited the Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum in Adams, MA, which <br/>
has been beautifully restored by owner Carol Crossed.</p>

<p>Joyce McCauley-Benner presented &ldquo;Victory over Violence&rdquo; to students at the College<br/>
of St. Scholastica (MN), hosted by The Guiding Star. The Guiding Star is a pregnancy<br/>
resource center serving the poor, students, working parents, and victims of violence.<br/>
After hearing Sally Winn speak in Duluth several years ago, The Guiding Star&rsquo;s founder<br/>
was inspired to put FFL&rsquo;s principles into practice.</p>

<p>Joyce also addressed six hundred students at UC Berkeley. Another speaker at the<br/>
 same event is a professor who has also performed abortions.  Draped in condoms,<br/>
 he waved a packet of RU-486 abortifacients, saying, &ldquo;See, just pills!&rdquo;  Despite<br/>
 overwhelming opposition, Joyce patiently answered questions from an audience surprised<br/>
to hear from a woman who chose &ldquo;victory over violence&rdquo; for herself and her child.</p>

<p>Former College Outreach Program Coordinator Chaunie Brusie addressed students at<br/>
 Seattle University. Now a mother of four and a labor and delivery nurse, Chaunie<br/>
has published Tiny Blue Lines, about her unplanned pregnancy and pro-life leadership<br/>
on a Michigan campus; it includes information about FFL&rsquo;s College Outreach Program.<br/>
(Seattle University invited Serrin this fall</p>
