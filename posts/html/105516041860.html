<p>2014 Was A Transformative Year! Experience it via our Annual Report</p>

<p>It is always our pleasure to share the powerful work of bold and<br/>
outrageous activists across the world who are fighting to end violence<br/>
against women and girls.<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=oZk6Xeh-fBUZ9Y_s3sl1vQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=oZk6Xeh-fBUZ9Y_s3sl1vQ</a></p>

<p>2014 was no different, it was a transformative year for V-Day and One<br/>
Billion Rising, where every rising was part of a collective energetic<br/>
decision to end violence and racial, environmental, economic and<br/>
gender injustice.</p>

<p>We stand in awe of what we were able to accomplish as a movement, and<br/>
we can only do what we do with your help! We hope you enjoy this<br/>
snapshot of another phenomenal year.</p>

solidarity.</p>
