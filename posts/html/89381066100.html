<p>Dear One Billion Rising and V-Day activists,</p>

<p>We are calling on your urgent help and support for our sisters in<br/>
Iraq. As we know, in times of conflict, women and girls are rendered<br/>
the most vulnerable to sexual violence.</p>

<p>Our long time V-Day sister Yanar Mohammed from Organization of Women&rsquo;s<br/>
Freedom in Iraq (OWFI)<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=ejR9YFUpZ36ukDHH-RerZA">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=ejR9YFUpZ36ukDHH-RerZA</a></p>

<p>writes to us:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Iraqi society is suffering unprecedented crisis that threatens<br/>
the future of peaceful co-existence of citizens, and augments<br/>
genocides and civil conflicts based on the sectarian identities that<br/>
were established on the Iraqi population, and were strengthened<br/>
throughout more than a decade of the American occupation to Iraq. This<br/>
coming week will be one of the deadliest in Iraq - with the politics<br/>
of division pushing us into such a dark corner, that the other half of<br/>
the Iraqis might be heading to battles with the other half. The ISIS<br/>
have a fatwa in Mosul that all residents should be willing to give<br/>
their unmarried daughters to &quot;Jihad Al Nikah&rdquo; or rather, sexual Jihad.<br/>
You can just imagine, the women who are brought to OFWI are from very<br/>
disciplined and conservative backgrounds, and then, all of a sudden,<br/>
they are taken for the pleasure of a war lord, but in the name of<br/>
somebody&rsquo;s Jihad - it just blows my mind. Four women have already<br/>
committed suicide after these violations. There are rumours that some<br/>
fathers were thinking of killing their daughters so as not to be<br/>
subject to the shame. In Baghdad, most of the families have a son who<br/>
volunteered to fight ISIS, and were sent to the frontlines without any<br/>
military training&hellip;anticipation and fear from the greater evil is in<br/>
everybody&rsquo;s hearts. It took us a week to absorb and believe that our<br/>
lives have gone down the drain, once again. And then again, we cannot<br/>
surrender to fate.&ldquo;</p>

<p>One Billion Rising has set up a Rising Fund<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=GqNxeaQ-gjKyMj7xwoivmg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=GqNxeaQ-gjKyMj7xwoivmg</a></p>

<p>to benefit women on the ground immediately. 100% of donations will go<br/>
directly to these efforts via the Organization of Women&rsquo;s Freedom Iraq<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=vYjgoh_mzAnQYCFt0Lp28Q">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=vYjgoh_mzAnQYCFt0Lp28Q</a></p>

<p>. Please consider donating whatever you can - everything and anything<br/>
will help. All funds will go to the current efforts of OWFI for the<br/>
following:</p>

<p>1.  Setting up a new house in the city of Karbala where a huge<br/>
displaced population is, where the women who lost their<br/>
families are vulnerable to the worst of situations.<br/>
2.  In Samarra which gets sieged every other day by ISIS, they are<br/>
supporting widows families with food provisions, and OWFI<br/>
continues provide shelter and support to the vulnerable.<br/>
3.  For Mosul, which is the worst zone, (presumed the capital of<br/>
the ISIS), OWFI are seeking to contact their supporters to<br/>
reach out to the women vulnerable to &quot;Jihad Al Nikah.&rdquo;  They<br/>
are finding ways to provide safe shelter and to explain to the<br/>
women that forced rape should not be the end of their life.</p>

<p>Please read the statement below from YANAR MOHAMMED to know more about<br/>
the context of the current situation in Iraq:</p>

<p>On the Occupation of Mosul and the Cities of Western Iraq</p>

<p>The Iraqi society is suffering unprecedented crisis that threatens the<br/>
future of peaceful co-existence of citizens, and augments genocides<br/>
and civil conflicts based on the sectarian identities that were<br/>
established on the Iraqi population, and were strengthened throughout<br/>
more than a decade of the American occupation to Iraq.</p>

<p>Mosul City has fallen along with Tikrit, and previously Fallujah,<br/>
under the control of considerably small troops of the Islamic State of<br/>
Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The war continues in other cities like Tel<br/>
Afar, Samaraa, and the cities of the western region. If the occupiers&rsquo;<br/>
mission succeeds, a large part of the Iraqi society would be ruled by<br/>
a brutal Islamic state that does not fit in our modern world<br/>
whatsoever; a state which sees an enemy in every human being  who<br/>
needs to be &ldquo;disciplined&rdquo; through humiliation, beating, and killing<br/>
until he/she becomes good enough to fit within the extreme religious<br/>
&ldquo;set of morals.&rdquo; This is a state that easily kills &ldquo;apostates&rdquo; and<br/>
commits genocides against the religious and political opponents, a<br/>
state that regards women merely as packages of flesh ready for the<br/>
entertainment of the Mujahideen. Many Fatwas come out to ensure<br/>
women&rsquo;s humiliation under being &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; for the new Caliphate-age<br/>
rapists, under the legislation of the so-called &ldquo;Jihad Al Nikah.&rdquo; In<br/>
spite of all these atrocities, a number of the residents of the fallen<br/>
cities joined them as a reaction to eight years of systemic sectarian<br/>
subjugation under  prime minister Nouri Al Maliki&rsquo;s rule.</p>
