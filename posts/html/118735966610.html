                    <p>VSL // Self Love Friday, Every Day</p>

<p>* Mind - Dan Harris&rsquo; personal journey and take on meditation in 10% Happier <http:> is refreshing, relatable and useful. He makes a pretty compelling case for making the time/space for a daily practice - even if it&rsquo;s just a few minutes each day. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>today’s Very Short List:<br/>
style 17 Apr 2015</p>

<p>Marissa Vosper <http:> and Lauren Schwab <http:>, co-founders of Negative Underwear <http:>, believe that good underwear is a form of self love - something you do to celebrate you every morning, something that should make you feel confident and comfortable in your own skin. Across mind, body and spirit, here are a few more of things that make them feel good, inside and out. INSTAGRAM <http:></http:></http:></http:></http:></p>

<p>* Body - The lovely ladies behind Sakara Life <http:> are on to something - uber healthy, supremely delicious plant-based food delivered straight to your door. The best remedy for the over-worked, on-the-go New Yorker who&rsquo;d otherwise be lost in a sea of takeout. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* Spirit - Intentional indulgence is most definitely a part of our personal self love mantra. The raw hot cacao with homemade almond milk from The Butcher&rsquo;s Daughter <http:> in Nolita is shared obsession (the most rich, delicious hot chocolate ever) or, when we&rsquo;re lucky enough to find ourselves out in L.A., the &lsquo;I am Immortal&rsquo; tonic at Cafe Gratitude <http:> in Venice Beach is a must.
