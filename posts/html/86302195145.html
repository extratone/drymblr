<p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>&ldquo;Feminist: the person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This succinct, unapologetic definition of feminism that Nigerian-born novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gave in a TED talk became a feminist shot heard &lsquo;round the world and was even sampled in one of Beyonce&rsquo;s latest tracks. Ms. has avidly followed Adichie&rsquo;s literary career from 2006 to now where she&rsquo;s become one of the most-talked-about writers in the US. </p>
