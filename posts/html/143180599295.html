                    <p>Hey there Dry!</p>

<p>The sun is shinning, birds are chirping, and flowers are blooming across your campuses. It&rsquo;s Spring, and we all know what that means â€“ finals! In the midst of studying, researching, writing, and presenting, take a break and fill out our *End of the Year Survey  [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16]! </p>

<p>Another semester is about to end, and you all have some incredible victories to show for it. This is your opportunity to humble-brag about all your awesome activism on campus, online, and in your communities. Many of y'all elected new Executive Board leaders, and we want to get to know them too!</p>

<p>Fill out our survey so we can learn more about your activism and the activists leading the fight! [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16]</p>

<p>I know you all are busy folks, so I promise this survey won&rsquo;t take longer than 5-10 minutes to complete. The feedback you all provide is critical for us to better serve y'all!</p>

<p>So take a few minutes to reflect on another fantastic semester of feminist activism and then tell us about it in our End of Year Survey [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/feminism16]!</p>

<p>In solidarity,</p>
