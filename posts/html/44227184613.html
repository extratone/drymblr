Dear Dry, </p>

<p>With your help, just moments ago, the House GOP Leadership failed in its attempt to gut the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The Senate-passed inclusive bipartisan VAWA just passed the House on a vote of 286-138 after the House GOP substitute bill went down to defeat on a vote of 166 to 257. </p>

<p>Thank you for all you have done. Women&rsquo;s groups and their allies acted as one and created a massive grassroots campaign to pass a strong VAWA despite the Republican House leadership opposition. WE cannot forget those who voted to roll back full protections of VAWA for college students, immigrants, and the LGBT community, Native Americans as well as the Office of Violence Against Women. </p>

<p>Our work has made a difference in the fight to end violence against women. This victory for all survivors sends a clear message that violence is violence no matter the victim. </p>

<p>For women&rsquo;s lives, </p>

<p>Eleanor Smeal<br/>
President<br/>
Feminist Majority Foundation </p>
