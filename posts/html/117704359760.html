Our Sisters In Nepal Need Your Urgent Support</p>

<p>The massive earthquake over the weekend in Nepal has left<br/>
thousands of people dead, thousands more feared missing, and millions<br/>
displaced<br/>
and homeless. The earthquake also caused the destruction of some of<br/>
Nepal&rsquo;s<br/>
most ancient, historical and spiritual sites.</p>

<p>Buildings have collapsed, communities are in shock and<br/>
overwhelmed with the pressing need for food, shelter and access to<br/>
medical aid, and<br/>
lives are ripped apart from the loss. Aftershocks are still being<br/>
felt, keeping<br/>
the physical conditions on the ground very unsafe. This means that<br/>
people are<br/>
not going to higher floors for fear of more collapse, and that people<br/>
are<br/>
staying out in the open roads. Movement has proved to be a challenge<br/>
because<br/>
the streets are still under rubble. There are still widespread<br/>
searches for<br/>
loved ones who are missing and who are not accounted for, and<br/>
hospitals are<br/>
stretched beyond capacity.</p>

<p>Today we are launching the RISING FUND for Nepal</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=6gJCMrL5LXComAkwveoPjg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=6gJCMrL5LXComAkwveoPjg</a></p>

<p>. Funds<br/>
raised will go to relief goods and urgent materials needs, as well as<br/>
psycho-social support and eventual rehabilitation. All funds will go<br/>
directly<br/>
to communities affected by the earthquake, administered and<br/>
facilitated by One<br/>
Billion Rising Nepal groups on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nepal has been the site of some of the most colourful,<br/>
political and cultural Risings in the last few years. Last September<br/>
2014, One Billion Rising Revolution South Asia was launched in<br/>
Kathmandu, with South Asian representatives from the Sangat South Asia<br/>
network in attendance, as well as so many civil society groups from<br/>
all over Nepal who came and rose together to end violence against<br/>
women and girls. It is heartbreaking to see images now of Nepal after<br/>
the earthquake destroyed so many of its&rsquo; historical monuments,<br/>
and the whose destruction has claimed the lives of thousands of<br/>
Nepalese and whose rising death toll has caused so much pain and<br/>
sorrow to its people. We are in touch with the many groups who have<br/>
been a part of One Billion Rising Nepal and South Asia and who are<br/>
leading relief efforts on the ground. </p>

<p>We appeal to One Billion Rising activists all over the world, to stand<br/>
and rise for our sisters and brothers in Nepal - as we did for our<br/>
sisters and brothers in Bangladesh when the garment factory, Rana<br/>
Plaza collapsed - and in the Philippines last year, when Typhoon<br/>
Haiyan devastated the city of Tacloban and neighbouring cities - with<br/>
both tragedies claiming thousands of lives. Your help and solidarity<br/>
provided much needed relief and support then, and we are appealing to<br/>
you all once again now, to donate so that the people of Nepal can<br/>
continue to Rise,&rdquo; stated Monique Wilson, One Billion Rising<br/>
Director. </p>

<p> WE RISE FOR OUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN NEPAL!</p>

<p>DONATE to the Rising Fund for Nepal &gt;</p>
