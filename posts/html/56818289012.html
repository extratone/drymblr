Dear Dry,</p>

<p>North Carolina Gov. Pat McCroy is about to pull a bait-and-switch. </p>

<p>This week, the Governor is expected to sign into law incredibly restrictive abortion legislation that would close all but one state clinic. Similar to the recently-passed Texas bill, the North Carolina legislation bans abortion at 20 weeks and imposes unneccessary regulations on abortion providers. </p>

<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, Gov. McCroy said during his 2012 campaign that he wouldn&rsquo;t impose any abortion restrictions if elected. </p>

<p>Take a look at this 30-second excerpt to see for yourself: [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJkGj_SbpbU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJkGj_SbpbU</a> ]</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable, isn&rsquo;t it? Just nine months after making such a promise, he completely goes back on his words. He&rsquo;s defending his action by saying the legislation doesn&rsquo;t restrict abortion, it makes it safer. If closing all but one clinic isn&rsquo;t restricting abortion, what is?</p>

<p>The Feminist Majority Foundation needs your help to hold politicians like Gov. McCroy accountable for their actions. Please, Dry, consider donating today to help us fight for women&rsquo;s reproductive rights in North Carolina.

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just about access to abortion</p>
