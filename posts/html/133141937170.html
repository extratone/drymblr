                    <p>How are you? My name is Tamara Salas and you?<br/>
I am from Tokyo. It was really interesting for me to read you profile. I want to keep company with you.<br/>
I read your profile and I like that you wrote about yourself. As for me I am a sushi chef and I am interested in reading.<br/>
I hope that you will write to me on my email or hotmail ID, do you have such one?<br/>
Please write back!</p>

<p>Warm regards Tamara Salas.</p>
