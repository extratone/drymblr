                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>You may have already heard the news. The first woman to ever be convicted of feticide was just sentenced to 20 years in prison for having a miscarriage. *This is horrifying. We must demand justice. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138</a> ]* 33-year-old Purvi Patel was convicted - based on highly contested junk science that was literally developed in the 17th century - of child neglect and feticide. </p>

<p> [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138</a> ] </p>

<p>Patel says she suffered a miscarriage and there is no evidence to show otherwise. It is an outrage to criminalize women for miscarrying. </p>

<p>*Sign the petition to tell Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and the Indiana State Legislature to &ldquo;Just Fix This,&rdquo; too! [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138</a> ]* Repeal the Indiana statewide law that threatens all pregnant women, especially women of color and low-income women with criminal prosecution for miscarriage. No woman in tragic circumstances should have to endure the cruel and unusual punishment of criminal prosecution for a miscarriage - and worse yet, conviction and imprisonment. Is Indiana becoming the state of no compassion and no tolerance? </p>

<p>*Click here to sign the petition demanding Indiana fix this now. [ <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138">http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/1269/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11138</a> ]* </p>
