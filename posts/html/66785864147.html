Hey Dry! </p>

<p>As you may have heard, Feminist Majority Foundation and its Feminist Campus program are joining forces with NARAL Pro-Choice America for CPC Week of Action [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/get-into-it-naral-and-fmfs-cpc-week-of-action-is-coming-up/">http://feministcampus.org/get-into-it-naral-and-fmfs-cpc-week-of-action-is-coming-up/</a> ] this week. We&rsquo;re hoping to mobilize young people around the nation to take action against the deceptive and misleading tactics practiced by Crisis Pregnancy Centers. CPCs target young women, women of color, and women from low-income backgrounds, and the lies need to end. This week, we&rsquo;re harnessing the power of social media to make it clear that women deserve better than medically inaccurate reproductive healthcare. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of ways to get involved this week, whether it&rsquo;s launching a campaign to expose fake clinics on your campus [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/fake-clinics/">http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/fake-clinics/</a> ] or tweeting with the hashtag [ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CallOutCPCs&amp;src=tyah&amp;f=realtime">https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CallOutCPCs&amp;src=tyah&amp;f=realtime</a> ]. You can take action with us almost anywhere so long as you&rsquo;re online: we&rsquo;re soliciting blog submissions (like this one [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/activism-101-starting-a-campaign-to-expose-fake-clinics-on-your-campus/">http://feministcampus.org/activism-101-starting-a-campaign-to-expose-fake-clinics-on-your-campus/</a> ]!) about actions folks have taken on campus or their personal stories about seeking treatment or help at a CPC, and you can submit to NARAL&rsquo;s Tumblr [ <a href="http://exposingfakeclinics.tumblr.com/">http://exposingfakeclinics.tumblr.com/</a> ] on exposing fake clinics to say what needs to be said in fewer words. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to bring the Week of Action home with you to campus, try postering with information about the fake clinics in your area or mobilizing folks to rally or protest with you outside ofone. Plus, you can fight back by supporting your local abortion clinic as well [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/adopt-a-clinic/">http://feministcampus.org/campaigns/adopt-a-clinic/</a> ]. </p>

<p>Good luck this week! Let&rsquo;s do all we can to. (If you need any support, advice, or resources, look no further than us â€“ we&rsquo;ve got you covered. You can email us anytime at campusteam@feminist.org [ mailto:campusteam@feminist.org ].) </p>

<p>As always, thanks for all that you do. </p>

<p>For women&rsquo;s lives, </p>
