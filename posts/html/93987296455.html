<p>Suzanne Blue Star Boy Remembers Women&rsquo;s Leader Tillie Black Bear</p>

<p><a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=3z0VZt4kxEEYh4yN2PvFPg">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=3z0VZt4kxEEYh4yN2PvFPg</a></p>

<p>The anti-violence movement was saddened to learn that the founder of<br/>
the National Indigenous Women&rsquo;s Resource Center, Tillie Black Bear,<br/>
had passed on. V-Day had the honor of working with Black Bear in 2003<br/>
when she served as an advisor to the Indian Country Project alongside<br/>
other Native American elders on the Kitchen Cabinet board.</p>

<p>The Indian Country Project&rsquo;s leader and Native Women&rsquo;s Activist,<br/>
Suzanne Blue Star Boy, has shared the following statement of<br/>
remembrance:</p>

<p>I had been aware of Tillie&rsquo;s work since I was a young woman living in<br/>
South Dakota on the Yankton Sioux Reservation. Tillie lived about<br/>
three hours away on the Rosebud Reservation. She became the face and<br/>
founder of the Native anti-domestic violence movement in 1978 when she<br/>
testified to congress about the prevalence of domestic violence in<br/>
Indian Country at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights thus<br/>
establishing herself as the Grandmother of the Battered Women&rsquo;s<br/>
Movement. As she spoke, I thought to myself &ldquo;who is this incredible<br/>
Lakota woman?&rdquo; Little did I know that she would one day be my guide,<br/>
my mentor, my auntie.</p>
