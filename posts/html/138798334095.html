<p>One Billion Rising 2016: The Revolution Escalates</p>

<p>indonesia poster.jpg<br/>
For the fourth year, globally One Billion Rising activists are<br/>
planning their rising events, artistic uprisings, panel discussions,<br/>
press conference, town halls, movies, articles, gatherings, poetry,<br/>
art, posters, actions, and protests to take place on and about 14<br/>
February. With the theme - ONE BILLION RISING: Rise for<br/>
REVOLUTION 2016, this year&rsquo;s campaign will escalate the collective<br/>
actions of activists worldwide, and amplify their call for systemic<br/>
changes towards ending violence against women and girls once and for<br/>
all.</p>

<p>Rising events will continue to focus on highlighting and creating bold<br/>
artistic initiatives that reflect the actions taking place in<br/>
communities. The theme Rise for Revolution allows creative and<br/>
artistic expressions, multi-sectoral involvement, and provides a<br/>
unique space to engage people from all walks of life. It allows the<br/>
use of imagination, art and political actions - and allows<br/>
everyone the freedom to localise their campaigns. REVOLUTION can bring<br/>
everyone from the personal to the political - from the &ldquo;I&rdquo; to<br/>
the &ldquo;We&rdquo;. It harnesses collective energy because it is hopeful and<br/>
envisions possibilities and a future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve danced, we&rsquo;ve demanded justice, we&rsquo;ve demanded changes. This<br/>
year we are radicalising our actions - enlarging, deepening and<br/>
expanding the revolution. Let&rsquo;s continue to shift consciousness and be<br/>
braver, bolder, more creative and determined with our actions.<br/>
Communities will focus on the most marginalised women and girls to<br/>
bring about true, long lasting change,&rdquo; stated Monique Wilson, Global<br/>
One Billion Rising Director.</p>

&ldquo;We are evolving our fight against violence against women, knowing<br/>
that unless we put the marginalized at the lead, unless we address<br/>
imperialism, war, climate change, racism, economic inequality, workers<br/>
rights and patriarchy we will never end violence against women and<br/>
girls. Let&rsquo;s go further than we have ever gone, igniting revolution<br/>
and paradigm change,&rdquo; stated Eve, Founder of One Billion Rising.</p>
