<p>V-Season 2014 is Here! Stage an Event!</p>

<p>Last year, you helped us rock the earth on 14 February 2013, and<br/>
joined ONE BILLION RISING to demand an end to violence against women<br/>
and girls. This year, we need your energy, passion, and joy once<br/>
again, as we launch the next wave,Â ONE<br/>
BILLION RISING FOR JUSTICE!<br/>
<a href="http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=AZI9X9tG6CLOBjIHXbvCqQ">http://action.vday.org/site/R?i=AZI9X9tG6CLOBjIHXbvCqQ</a></p>

<p>We invite you to join the College &amp; Community Campaigns, the heart<br/>
of V-Day&rsquo;s grassroots activism. For 16 years, every February through<br/>
April, anti-violence activists around the world have produced V-Day<br/>
events in their communities and raised awareness, plus millions of<br/>
dollars, for local organizations working to end violence against women<br/>
and girls.</p>

<p>WATCH Eve&rsquo;s Monologue, &ldquo;One Billion Will Rise for Justice&rdquo;<br/>

<p>For V-Season 2014, V-Day has a wide variety of events, including two<br/>
new pieces.</p>

<p>Eve&rsquo;s most recent theatrical works Emotional Creature and The Good<br/>
Body are now available through arrangement with Dramatist&rsquo;s Play<br/>
Service (for a small fee). Emotional Creature has been called &ldquo;A<br/>
joyous, girl-powered production&rdquo; by The New York Times, and<br/>
&ldquo;Absolutely magnetic&rdquo; by Entertainment Weekly. With The Good Body, Eve<br/>
Ensler explores women&rsquo;s relationships to the rest of their bodies. The<br/>
San Francisco Chronicle called it &ldquo;Passionate, funny, frank,<br/>
revealing, even shocking, and genuinely committed to improving life on<br/>
this planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All events will be a part of ONE BILLION RISING FOR JUSTICE.<br/>
You can apply to organize one, some, or all of the following:</p>
