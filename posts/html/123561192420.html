<p>Creating Choreography In Your Culture and<br/>
Community - Revolutionize &quot;BREAK THE CHAIN&quot;</p>

<p>m2FX0Y8b2VigDmpVJvPNCvqlz20YUFperkVrG2u8N_A.jpeg</p>

<p>Throughout the first three years of One Billion Rising,<br/>
activists have creatively used the &ldquo;Break The Chain&rdquo; song and<br/>
choreography in their communities.  <br/>
Since it was released in late 2012, the song has been translated into<br/>
over 15 languages making the message more accessible, the song more<br/>
local.</p>

<p>Communities around the world have also adapted, localised<br/>
and completely re-envisioned the choreography, in many places<br/>
integrating the<br/>
dance into their cultures so that it remains current and relevant.<br/>
These<br/>
incredible dances (as well as the original ones) have been shared<br/>
throughout<br/>
the campaign, they are unique and inspiring. This year, as the<br/>
movement evolves<br/>
into its fourth year, activists are invited to create and send in<br/>
fresh new<br/>
versions of &ldquo;Break The Chain&rdquo; - original moves that<br/>
express the<br/>
energy and message of One Billion Rising for your communities and<br/>
groups and<br/>
networks.</p>

<p>SEND in a video of you, your friends or your whole community<br/>
dancing your original &ldquo;Break The Chain&rdquo; choreography. We<br/>
will upload it, along<br/>
with other videos we receive, and send them across OBR networks around<br/>
the<br/>
world, to share all the different dance moves activists can choose<br/>
from, and to<br/>
continue to inspire global solidarity!</p>

<p>The 2015-2016 year of risings will continue the REVOLUTION<br/>
theme, so envision and create wild, radical dance moves that free and<br/>
liberate<br/>
the body, that can move people into defiance, joy, courage,<br/>
empowerment and community.</p>

<p>As in years before, using choreography is just suggestion,<br/>
NOT a requirement or a mandate.</p>

<p>Organizers and risers are encouraged to continue to localize<br/>
their artistic expressions however they want including any version of<br/>
the<br/>
choreography your community chooses. Or multiple versions,<br/>
there&rsquo;s no limit to<br/>
how many ways you can DANCE! </p>

<p>Break the Chain and DANCE for Revolution!</p>
