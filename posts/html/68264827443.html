                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>With Thanksgiving quickly approaching, families across the country are looking forward to rich and filling holiday feasts. While others celebrate though, fast-food workers-many of whom are expected to scrap by on just $7.25/hour-may struggle to afford such festivities. </p>

<p>Our new edition of Ms. [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] features today&rsquo;s Rosie the Riveter: the woman taking your fast-food order. Fed up, she&rsquo;s striking for a $15/hour paycheck that will allow her to cover basic needs and stop her from making impossible choices about food and housing. </p>

<p>Trust me: When you read the facts about a $200 billion industry that primarily employs - and exploits - women, you&rsquo;ll never look at your hamburger the same way. </p>

<p>Get the full story in our newest edition of Ms.! [ <a href="http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx">http://store.feminist.org/getandgivems.aspx</a> ] </p>
