Dear Dry, </p>

<p>Anti-abortion extremists are coming to Kansas on Saturday. </p>

<p>*Tell Kansas Governor Sam Brownback to publicly denounce the dangerous and inflammatory tactics of anti-abortion extremists who are coming to Wichita.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20087">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20087</a> ]</p>

<p>Operation Save America (OSA) will be waging a week-long campaign in Wichita from July 16-23 and holding daily protests in front of &ldquo;the local abortion mills,&rdquo; Planned Parenthood and Trust Women South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center, which we believe will be their main target.</p>

<p>Their goal is to recreate the 1991 &ldquo;Summer of Mercy,&rdquo; in which tens of thousands of anti-abortion protesters flooded Wichita to block women&rsquo;s access to abortion. For six weeks they shut down the clinic, Women&rsquo;s Health Care Services, resulting in the arrest of over 2,700 anti-abortion protesters. That clinic was run by Dr. George Tiller who was murdered in his church by an extremist in 2009. Three years ago, Tiller&rsquo;s mentee Julie Burkhart opened the Trust Women South Wind Women&rsquo;s Center in the exact same location as Tiller&rsquo;s clinic. The South Wind clinic is facing constant threats, intimidation and harassment. </p>

<p>According to Rusty Thomas, the leader of OSA, &ldquo;The abortion mill in Wichita representsâ€¦a high place of child sacrifice. This high place needs to be plucked up, rooted out, overthrown, and vanquished from Wichita.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They are calling on the Governor, as well as local leaders and sheriffs, to ignore Roe v. Wade and the United States Constitution, and unlawfully shut down South Wind, threatening the lives of thousands of Kansas women.  </p>

<p>*Send Governor Brownback a message that it is time to take a stand against the bullies and extremists while supporting women and their health care providers.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20087">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20087</a> ]</p>

<p>The Feminist Majority Foundation&rsquo;s 2014 National Clinic Violence Survey shows that 51.9% of abortion clinics experienced threats and targeted intimidation. One in five women&rsquo;s health clinics experienced severe anti-abortion violence. </p>

<p>*Email Governor Brownback now [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20087">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20087</a> ].* We are determined to stop anti-abortion harassment-but to do that, we need help.</p>
