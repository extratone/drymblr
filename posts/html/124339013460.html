                                    <h1>Final Weekend of Siege: Help protect the only abortion clinic left in Montgomery, Alabama</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>

<p>Alabama&rsquo;s Reproductive Health Services clinic – the only abortion clinic left in Montgomery, Alabama – needs your help. *We&rsquo;re halfway to our goal of raising $10,000 **to pay for security improvements and additional security costs** for their facility - give today to help ensure this vital work is done!* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=BuEQXsiiU9uZWpdnj8ZuR93VunG0KwlC">http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=BuEQXsiiU9uZWpdnj8ZuR93VunG0KwlC</a> ]</p>

<p>Right now, anti-abortion extremists from across the country are in Montgomery and have descended upon this vitally needed clinic. Operation Save America (&ldquo;OSA&rdquo;) is leading national demonstrations against this clinic. Our Clinic Defense Team is on the ground in Alabama as we write, preparing for the final weekend of activities and providing assistance to the clinic to counter these out of state extremists. Yesterday, our Team arrived at the clinic very early.  Dozens of anti-abortion protesters were already there. Working with law enforcement and community activists, we made sure all clinic staff and patients were protected and the clinic stayed open. *That&rsquo;s the difference our Clinic Defense Team can make with your support. *</p>



<p>*Stand shoulder to shoulder with this clinic and its health care providers by sending a donation. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=6aigPP6gDtZ2sFWBKGEHI93VunG0KwlC">http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=6aigPP6gDtZ2sFWBKGEHI93VunG0KwlC</a> ]* Half of your tax-deductible gift will go directly to the Reproductive Health Services clinic for improving security measures, and half will support our Clinic Defense Team that works to keep Reproductive Health Services and other targeted clinics open and safe.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Last Saturday night Alabama&rsquo;s State Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore spoke at OSA&rsquo;s opening rally. Last night, Matthew Trewhella, an unapologetic advocate of justifiable homicide of abortion providers, spoke at OSA&rsquo;s evening rally. And today, convicted clinic arsonist and advocate of justifiable homicide, John Brockhoeft, has joined OSA&rsquo;s protests.  </p>



<p>Can you imagine? The Chief Justice of Alabama&rsquo;s highest court – also a virulent opponent of same-sex marriage – is an OSA featured speaker, along with a man who signed the Defensive Action petition, which supported the use of lethal force, if necessary, to stop abortion.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>

<p>*Help us provide critically needed funds to Reproductive Health Services and support the FMF&rsquo;s work protecting this vital clinic in Alabama.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=yMIBe4NtyqrcJTGT4meXWd3VunG0KwlC">http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=yMIBe4NtyqrcJTGT4meXWd3VunG0KwlC</a> ]</p>

<p>The clinic has just spent tens of thousands of dollars to comply with medically unnecessary draconian building regulations forced on them by the state. Now that it is targeted, the clinic needs emergency funds to improve its security system.</p>



<p></p>



<p>*Help us provide Reproductive Health Services needed emergency funding at this critical time. *</p>

<p>*Please make a tax-deductible contribution today to support Reproductive Health Services and our Clinic Defense team. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=mZuo74OO%2FwsxrGPwPcLa7acVhC31P%2Fju">http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=mZuo74OO%2FwsxrGPwPcLa7acVhC31P%2Fju</a> ]*</p>



<p></p>



<p>In spite of repeated legislative attacks and anti-abortion extremist harassment and intimidation – this Alabama clinic and its courageous staff are standing strong and maintaining safe abortion access for women.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>

<p>Immediately after our Alabama trip, our Clinic Defense team will be in Indiana helping other targeted clinics.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>*Without clinics, there is no choice [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=l%2B5pgveHlRIY3ArD81tEmN3VunG0KwlC">http://org.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=l%2B5pgveHlRIY3ArD81tEmN3VunG0KwlC</a> ]**. *Please help Reproductive Health Services in Montgomery keep its staff and patients safe.</p>

PS. We need to raise at least $10,000 to help fortify this embattled provider and to help our Clinic Defense Team in combating these summer clinic sieges, and we&rsquo;re so close! *Please forward this email to 10 friends and give generously today.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12676">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=12676</a> ]</p>
