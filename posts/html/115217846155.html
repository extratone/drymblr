                    <p>Hey, Dry, </p>

<p>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), and we want you and your group to get involved, raise awareness, and create action on campus! </p>

<p>Sexual Assault Awareness Month occurs each year in April, and this year&rsquo;s national SAAM campaign is specifically focused on the campus sexual assault epidemic.There&rsquo;s a lot you can do on campus to spread the word, get people galvanized for change, and support survivors - all before the semester ends. On our blog, we&rsquo;ve outlined five ways to get active this month, [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/its-saam2015-here-are-four-ways-to-get-involved/">http://feministcampus.org/its-saam2015-here-are-four-ways-to-get-involved/</a> ] but we&rsquo;ve got a special opportunity for campus leaders like you. We&rsquo;ll be negotiating discounts for interested students who want to screen &ldquo;The Hunting Ground&rdquo; on campus this April! </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hunting Ground,&rdquo; [ <a href="http://www.thehuntinggroundfilm.com/">http://www.thehuntinggroundfilm.com/</a> ] a new documentary from the filmmakers behind &ldquo;The Invisible War,&rdquo; on your very own campus! &ldquo;The Hunting Ground&rdquo; explores the reality of sexual assault on campus - and the intimidating mess of policies and practices survivors must navigate as they seek justice. Check out the trailer below, and *if you&rsquo;re interested in hosting a screening, **email us [ mailto:campusteam@feminist.org?subject=%22The%20Hunting%20Ground%22%20campus%20screening ]** by 12 PM EST on Friday, April 3 - we&rsquo;ll negotiate a discount for you.*</p>
