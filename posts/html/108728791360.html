                    <p>Hey Dry! </p>



<p>*Sign our petition to stand with Tennessee women, [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] who are fighting multiple anti-abortion measures in the Tennessee legislature right now. *Take action to show lawmakers in Tennessee and in every state that we will not stand idly by as they attack reproductive rights. </p>



<p> [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] </p>



<p>With new power to regulate abortion as a result of the narrow passage of Amendment 1 - a dangerous amendment to the state constitution that strips privacy protections from the state constitution that prevented extreme abortion restrictions - Republicans are taking up multiple anti-abortion measures. These bills include unnecessary and harassing clinic inspections, mandatory counseling, waiting periods, and forced ultrasounds, and requiring doctors to deliver manipulative and deceiving information to their patients about abortions. </p>



<p></p>

<p>*That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re petitioning Governor Bill Haslam, Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey, and House Speaker Beth Harwell to implore them and the entire Tennessee General Assembly to respect a women&rsquo;s right to abortion access.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] </p>



<p></p>

<p>*Sign the petition now and stop the state attacks on abortion rights. This fight is far from over. [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16942</a> ] *We will send in your signed petitions to stand with Tennessee women. </p>



<p><br/>
Sincerely, </p>
