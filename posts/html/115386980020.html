                    <p>VSL // Small Town Spirit</p>

<p>* I’m fascinated with learning about life in Boston throughout history, so I’m a frequent visitor to the Massachusetts Historical Society’s digital archives <http:>. We released a new spirit last fall called Hub Punch, which is a nod to the historic rum libation of the same name, and we actually created the recipe for our version by consulting pre-Prohibition-era advertisements for the original spirit dating from the 1800s.

<p>Dave Willis is the co-founder and head distiller of Bully Boy Distillers <http:>, Boston’s first craft distillery, which makes small-batch, handcrafted rums, whiskeys and vodka paying homage to the spirit of Boston. TWITTER <http:>  INSTAGRAM <http:></http:></http:></http:></p>

<p>* As I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to appreciate my small town roots and family farm (pictured here). One of my favorite books, Gilead by Marilynne Robinson <http:>, expresses a piece of that same sentiment of being inspired by your land and community throughout life. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* We always keep music playing at the distillery and have been listening to a lot of Delta Spirit <http:> lately. It&rsquo;s easygoing background music, and a great soundtrack for sampling the new whiskeys we’ve been working on. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
