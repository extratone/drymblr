<p>Dear Customers,</p>

<p>At Harbor Freight Tools, one of our guiding values is &ldquo;Doing the Right Thing&rdquo; for our customers, our communities and our employees. As we&rsquo;ve continued to explore ways to make Harbor Freight an even better place to work, one of the things we heard from many of our store managers was that staying open until 9:00 PM meant that lots of our employees missed the chance to have family time in the evenings and often missed seeing their kids before bedtime.</p>

<p>The good news is that there was something we could do about that. So starting February 1st, all of our stores that currently close at 9:00 PM will close an hour earlier&hellip;at 8:00 PM. For your local store&rsquo;s new hours, go to <br/>

HarborFreight.com .</p>

<p>I know this change means that some of you will have to shop with us earlier in the day and I apologize for any inconvenience that may cause.</p>

<p>On behalf of all our Harbor Freight employees who now have a little more balance in their lives, I want to thank you for coming in a little earlier and helping us make Harbor Freight a great place to work.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><br/>
