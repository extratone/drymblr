                    <p>VSL // The Power Of The Written Word</p>

<p>* Looking for something to read that&rsquo;s short, sweet, and not on a screen? Peruse the tables at this weekend&rsquo;s Feminist Zine Fest <http:> in NYC. Meet the people behind the print, pick up some zines, and perhaps get inspired to make one of your own. [1 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>today’s Very Short List:<br/>
lit 4 Mar 2015</p>

<p>Writer/editor Victoria Law <http:> is a strong believer in the power of the written word. She’s edited the zine Tenacious: Art &amp; Writings by Women in Prison since 2002, is the author of Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women, and continues to write about intersections of incarceration, gender and resistance.

<p>* Looking for more? Check out the POC Zine Project <http:>, which (as its name indicates) spotlights zines by people of color across the country. And what a wide range there are—from political zines like Black Women Matter to food and recipe zines. [2 of 3]</http:></p>

<p>* And if you really really want more, check out the thousands upon thousands of zines at the ABC No Rio <http:> zine library on NYC&rsquo;s Lower East Side. If you&rsquo;re not sure what you&rsquo;re looking for, the zine librarian can help you navigate the bulging shelves and overflow boxes. [3 of 3]</http:></p>
