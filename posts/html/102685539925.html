                                    <h1>Hey, TIME: "Feminist" is Not Your Word to Ban</h1>
                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>&ldquo;TIME &quot;has decided to include the word &quot;feminist&rdquo; in its annual &ldquo;worst words&rdquo; poll, alongside words like &ldquo;bae,&rdquo; &ldquo;basic,&rdquo; &ldquo;turnt,&rdquo; and &ldquo;yaaasssss.&rdquo; </p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re not buying it. *If you&rsquo;re not either, sign the petition.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16713">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16713</a> ] </p>



<p>&ldquo;Feminist&rdquo; is an important word, not a meme. In fact, millions of women and men around the world like you who believe in the social, economic, and political equality of all women identify as &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; - including Taylor Swift, who is currently on &ldquo;TIME&rdquo;&rsquo;s cover. So we don&rsquo;t really care if the word makes a few people at &ldquo;TIME&rdquo; &ldquo;cringe,&rdquo; or if celebrities publicly coming out as feminists annoys them. Actually, we think it&rsquo;s about time so many people are talking about feminism and how to achieve equality. </p>

<p>If &ldquo;TIME &quot;is annoyed with a word that represents saving women&rsquo;s lives, fighting for equality, and ending violence against women, then there&rsquo;s something wrong with &quot;TIME &rdquo;- and not with the word &ldquo;feminist.&rdquo; </p>

<p>*Tell &ldquo;TIME &quot;that &quot;feminist&rdquo; is not their word to ban.* [ <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16713">http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1400/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16713</a> ]</p>
