<p>The global fight to end gender-based violence will take center stage today when the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Organizations, Human Rights, Democracy, and Global Women&rsquo;s Issues holds a hearing on how the US and the international community can work to prevent violence against women, promote women&rsquo;s rights, and empower women and girls globally.</p>

<p>Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), chair, will preside over the hearing. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Patty Murray (D-WA) will testify, among others. </p>

<p>Senator Boxer introduced the bipartisan International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA) [ <a href="https://www.boxer.senate.gov/en/press/releases/050814a.cfm">https://www.boxer.senate.gov/en/press/releases/050814a.cfm</a> ] in May as a step toward reducing violence against women worldwide. The international community has also used CEDAW, also known as the Women&rsquo;s Treaty, as a tool to fight violence against women globally.  The United States is still the only industrialized country that has not ratified CEDAW (the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). Although 187 countries have ratified the treaty, the US has not, joining Iran, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tonga, and Palau in its failure to do so. </p>

<p>While you&rsquo;re watching today&rsquo;s webcast, please take a minute to sign our petition and urge your Senator to take action on CEDAW.  [ <a href="http://www.feminist.org/news/pdfs/CEDAW_2014FMF.pdf">http://www.feminist.org/news/pdfs/CEDAW_2014FMF.pdf</a> ] </p>

<p>Gender-based violence is the most widespread human rights violation around the world. According to the World Health Organization [ <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/</a> ] at least 35% of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime, although some national studies show prevalence rates as high as 70% [ <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures">http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures</a> ]. In conflict zones, women are more susceptible to rape, which has been systematically used as a weapon of war. Child marriage also continues to be a scourge. More than 64 million girls worldwide are child brides [ <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures">http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures</a> ] who suffer from sexual assault and life-threatening early pregnancy [ <a href="http://feministcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GlobalCampaign_2014.pdf">http://feministcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GlobalCampaign_2014.pdf</a> ]. One in nine girls in the developing world are married before age 15, and 90% of pregnancies to girls under age 18 occur within child marriage according to a recent UNFPA report [ <a href="http://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2013/10/31/over-7-million-births-to-girls-in-the-developing-world-each-year/">http://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2013/10/31/over-7-million-births-to-girls-in-the-developing-world-each-year/</a> ]. </p>

<p>Women can&rsquo;t wait for – and must demand – an end to violence around the world.
