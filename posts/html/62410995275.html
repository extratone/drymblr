                    <p>Dear Dry, </p>

<p>The Feminist Majority is thrilled to announce two more amazing speakers for this year&rsquo;s 2013 Women, Money, Power Summit: Tina Tchen, chief of staff to First Lady Michelle Obama, and Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers for America. </p>

<p>Make sure you register today for this amazing event on October 8 at the Capitol Hilton hotel in Washington, DC! [ <a href="http://feministmajority.org/women-money-power/2013WomenMoneyPower/registration.htm">http://feministmajority.org/women-money-power/2013WomenMoneyPower/registration.htm</a> ] </p>

<p>Tchen, who also serves as the executive director of the White House Council on Women and Girls, will be leading our afternoon town hall discussion on the Affordable Care Act and what women need to know and do. </p>

<p>Huerta will speak at our luncheon honoring three fearless trailblazing feminists: Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a champion for equal pay for women; Texas state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, a courageous fighter for reproductive rights; and Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyer&rsquo;s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law who is leading the charge for voters&rsquo; rights. </p>

<p>Our other General Assembly Sessions throughout the day will focus on improving global reproductive family planning practices, ending violence against women and stopping the War on Women once and for all! We&rsquo;ll also discuss new strategies to ratify both CEDAW and the Equal Rights Amendment. </p>
