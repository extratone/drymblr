<p>Thank You ONE BILLION RISING For Rocking The World</p>

<p>To all of our activists, regardless of how you rose THANK YOU for<br/>
making 14 February 2013 the largest global action in history to end<br/>
violence against women and girls! </p>

<p>&ldquo;Together on 14 February, we expressed our outrage and joy and<br/>
our firm global call for a world where women are free and safe and<br/>
cherished and equal. One Billion Rising brought together<br/>
coalitions of groups and individuals that have never worked together<br/>
before and galvanized new supporters and associations and masses of<br/>
men who were not previously engaged, but now see violence as their<br/>
issue. It did all of this while putting violence against women to the<br/>
center of the global discussion. One Billion Rising has broken taboos,<br/>
lifted the veil of silence, and inspired a radical outpouring of<br/>
support to reveal the worldwide system of patriarchy, which sustains<br/>
the violence. One Billion Rising has shown that violence against women<br/>
is not a national, tribal, ethnic, or religious issue, but a global<br/>
phenomenon, and that through this worldwide rising and support,<br/>
survivors can be given the confidence of knowing that violence is not<br/>
their fault.&rdquo; - Eve Ensler </p>

<p>Today we celebrate these victories, and we hope you do to. Now ask<br/>
yourself WHAT CAN I DO IMMEDIATELY TO END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND<br/>
GIRLS - and then go out and DO IT!</p>

<p>One Billion Rising was always conceived to be a catalyst and a wind<br/>
rather than a new organization. So use it to fuel your next<br/>
activities, you can: PLAN local actions for International Women&rsquo;s Day<br/>
(8 March), STAGE a V-Day benefit in your community, WORK for political<br/>
action in your community or country like the VAWA (Violence Against<br/>
Women Act) effort in the U.S.</p>

<p>VICTORIES</p>

<p>1.    Brought together people across movements and causes -<br/>
mobilizing communities such as migrants, women in prison,<br/>
domestic workers, urban poor, LGBTQI, farm workers, the<br/>
disabled, and many more.<br/>
2.    Created the opportunity for councils of indigenous women to<br/>
participate in global problem solving. <br/>
3.    Created global solidarity and strength cutting across<br/>
borders, races, class, religions, sexual orientation, ages,<br/>
genders. Reignited solidarity between women&rsquo;s organizations<br/>
in various countries. Rekindled the ethos of sisterhood<br/>
amongst women on a global scale.<br/>
4.    Brought to the surface the intersection of issues both<br/>
causing and affecting violence against women: patriarchy,<br/>
poverty, corporate greed, environmental plunder, imperialist<br/>
policies, religion, militarization, interventions of outside<br/>
countries, immigration, labor export policies,<br/>
nationalization of industries, political repression. <br/>
5.    Engaged masses on a deeper, more embodied level through<br/>
dancing, poetry, singing, and art.<br/>
6.    Produced massive media exposure, discourse, and advocacy on<br/>
violence against women issues. It also created or was the<br/>
catalyst for the development of millions of women citizen<br/>
social media journalists telling their own narratives by<br/>
picking up cameras. <br/>
7.    Created solidarity and safe and free space, through our<br/>
creativity and numbers, for violated women to tell their<br/>
stories, many for the first time, and heal their trauma by<br/>
dancing in public, communal open spaces.<br/>
8.    Inspired millions of men to stand and rise as our allies,<br/>
deconstructing patriarchy alongside us. <br/>
9.    Galvanized and empowered legislators to generate legislation<br/>
in support of ending violence against women and girls<br/>
globally. Created an opportunity for globally linked<br/>
women&rsquo;s councils to lobby at all levels of government<br/>
and UN.<br/>
10.   Increased funding and support for programs and education to<br/>
end violence and women and girls.<br/>
11.   Made violence against women impossible to ignore and never to<br/>
be marginalized again. Reminded the world that women united<br/>
will never be defeated.<br/>
12.   Generated the best collection of worldwide dance videos<br/>
ever! </p>
