<p>Grants to Bring FFL Speakers to You<br/>

<p>Dear Dry ,<br/>
Because of the generosity of some Feminists for Life donors, we are able to offer<br/>
partial grants, so that campus leaders can host the best pro-woman, pro-life speakers<br/>
in the nation.</p>

<p>FFL President Serrin M. Foster is the creator of the Women Deserve BetterÂ®campaign.<br/>
Her landmark speech, &ldquo;The Feminist Case AgainstAbortion,&rdquo; has been recognized as<br/>
 one of the &ldquo;great speeches in history&rdquo; in an anthology called Women&rsquo;s Rights. She<br/>
has focused on developing on-campus resources and support for under-served pregnant<br/>
and parenting students and is an outspoken opponent of pregnancy discrimination.</p>

<p>I know many of you are very concerned about the issue of rape and pregnancy. Consider<br/>
inviting Joyce McCauley-Benner [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001Ghw_iLkJvljv-bYgvyFRC0Uuieoxtb5ikDIWtBKAXUcaB3CwXbZ_8lmUfZ8HYDVuXucVzn3IsSTxSPmSEYKK5nv29xubTWPCOUvZ_E3ECZzmNt5opP5DAZmweprrww7JLzKYZRbIy1J0AqSivEGw1YCtcsH0I04cWOwIkryJTHA=]<br/>
to campus. She didn&rsquo;t know who the father was, but she knew who the mother was and<br/>
chose victory over violence!</p>

<p>If you are in the DC area and want a speaker who can talk about her experience as<br/>
a birthmother, then former FFL Board Member Jessica O'Connor-Petts would be a great<br/>
option. She became pregnant shortly after graduating from university in 1996 but<br/>
 continued with her plan to move to Washington, D.C. to work in public policy and<br/>
row competitively. With the loving support of family, friends, and caregivers, she<br/>
made an adoption plan for her birthson, including four joyful weeks with him after<br/>
his birth. Ms. O'Connor-Petts&rsquo; birthson, his little sister, and his adoptive parents<br/>
were part of her wedding in 2003.<br/>
We also have two speakers who know the challenges of being pregnant and parenting<br/>
while still college undergraduates. Chaunie M. Brusie became a student mother her<br/>
senior year of college. She shared her personal story as a pregnant student who <br/>
challenged the status quo in FFL&rsquo;s 2007 e-series, Chaunie&rsquo;s Journey. After interning<br/>
with Feminists for Life, Chaunie founded S.U.P.P.O.R.T., a campus organization dedicated<br/>
to creating resources and support for pregnant and parenting students like herself.<br/>
Chaunie graduated on time with her bachelor&rsquo;s degree one week before delivering <br/>
her daughter. In 2007 she was awarded the National Association of Pro-Life Nurses<br/>
Award. As FFL&rsquo;s former College Outreach Program Coordinator, Chaunie helped student<br/>
activists to transform campuses across the nation in support of pro-woman solutions.<br/>
I also became unexpectedly pregnant my junior year of college. In my lecture, &ldquo;Refuse<br/>
to Choose: Reclaiming Feminism,&rdquo; I share my own experience as a pro-choice college<br/>
student facing obstacles as a pregnant and parenting student. These obstacles nearly<br/>
cost my daughter her life. My tenure as Feminists for Life&rsquo;s Vice President began<br/>
in 2001, and I&rsquo;ve been advocating for pregnant and parenting college students across<br/>
the country and internationally ever since. Before coming to FFL, I co-founded Democrats<br/>
for Life of America. I&rsquo;ve also served as the Director of Operations for a therapeutic<br/>
group maternity home serving pregnant and parenting teens in the Pacific Northwest.<br/>
Quite proudly I also carried on the legacy of our feminist foremothers as Executive<br/>
Director of the Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum in Adams, Massachusetts.<br/>
Serrin, Joyce and I are also experienced FFL Pregnancy Resource Forum Moderators<br/>

 Partial grants are available for the Forums as well.<br/>
